        "targetParagraphs": "DEARBORN, Mich. - Ford, the only U.S. automaker to avoid bankruptcy court, clawed its way to a US$2.7-billion profit in 2009 and expects to stay in the black in 2010. It was the automaker's first annual profit in four years.Ford's full-year revenue of $118.3 billion fell nearly 20 per cent from 2008, but the Dearborn-based automaker benefited from cost-cutting, a $696 million profit in its credit arm and popular cars and trucks like the Ford Fusion midsize sedan and Ford Escape small SUV. It gained market share in North and South America and Europe, despite the worst U.S. sales climate in 30 years.\"While we still face significant business environment challenges ahead, 2009 was a pivotal year for Ford,\" Ford CEO Alan Mulally said in a statement.Ford shares rose 32 cents, or nearly three per cent, to $11.87 in premarket trading.Ford's 2009 net income of 86 cents per share showed a significant improvement from the year before, when it lost a record $14.6 billion. Before severance payments and retiree health care charges, Ford made 43 cents per share.The profit surprised Wall Street, where analysts expected an annual loss of 31 cents.Ford made money in three of the four quarters last year. In the fourth quarter, it earned $868 million, or 25 cents per share, compared with a loss of $5.9 billion a year earlier. Ford's quarterly revenue of $35.4 billion was up 22 per cent from a year earlier.Ford was able to predict a profit this year because of small signs of economic growth, lower costs and its ability to get higher prices for its vehicles, said chief financial officer Lewis Booth. Previously, Ford had only forecast that it would be \"solidly profitable\" in 2011.Fourth-quarter sales in Europe and North America were also stronger than expected, he said.Still, Booth said signs of economic recovery were tenuous. Ford is expecting U.S. industry sales of 11.5 million to 12.5 million vehicles in 2010, up from 10.4 million last year. But that's down from sales of 17 million as recently as 2005.\"We are worried about how fragile that may be,\" he said.The company said it cut manufacturing, engineering, sales and advertising costs by $5.1 billion last year, $500 million of that in the fourth quarter.Booth did not think his company benefited from a spate of safety-related recalls at Toyota Motor Corp., but said Ford will look for opportunities to improve its market share.We're going to focus on doing it with our own products,\" he said.The company said it would match or beat last year's U.S. market share of 15.3 per cent, which was up 1.1 percentage points.Ford finished the year with $34.3 billion in debt, up $7.4 billion from the end of the third quarter. That was largely due to the company taking on $7 billion in debt it owes a retiree health care trust fund run by the United Auto Workers union. That puts Ford at a disadvantage to GM and Chrysler, which were able to shed debt in bankruptcy court.Booth said the company has \"an uncompetitive balance sheet\" and will continue to work on cutting its debt this year. He would not say what steps it would take other than generating enough cash from operations to make payments.We're not kidding ourselves. We know we've still got a lot of debt on our balance sheet,\" he said.",

        "targetParagraphs": "The discovery of the presence of airborne asbestos in a middle school in Montclair, New Jersey Friday prompted the evacuation of over 200 students from the school and the school's closure. Renaissance Middle School, part of the Montclair Public Schools in New Jersey, was closed Monday and remains closed Tuesday while undergoing asbestos testing and cleaning.According to a letter sent home to parents by the Superintendent's Office of Montclair Public Schools on Friday, \"plaster may have been disturbed\" during construction on new fire doors at the Renaissance School building on Thursday.An inspection arranged by the school district indicated asbestos was present in the plaster, and a subsequent inspection performed by asbestos consultant Detail Associates revealed \"a level of airborne asbestos fibers that exceeded the acceptable range\" in the third floor hallway of the school. Montclair Public Schools business administrator Dana Sullivan told The Star-Ledger that testing conducted on March 31 revealed the presence of asbestos in a brown undercoating of plaster at the Renaissance School building.The affected area was sealed off, and some students were moved to other areas of the building while others were moved to off-site locations. District Public Information Officer Laura Federico told The Montclair Times that sixth and seventh graders were transported to Hillside Elementary School, and eighth graders were bussed to Montclair High School. \"The safety of our students and staff is always our first concern,\" said Federico.According to The Montclair Times, Detail Associates conducted a cleaning protocol at the school on Saturday and tested the building to make sure it did not contain unacceptable levels of asbestos fibers. The letter sent to parents Friday by the Superintendent's Office said that Detail Associates had told the district that the building would be \"cleaned, tested and cleared for occupancy by Monday morning\". The school remained closed Monday, and a meeting was held between parents and school district officials. A Parent-Teacher Association meeting is planned for Wednesday night.The Star-Ledger reported that the ongoing asbestos cleanup of the school is being supervised by the state Department of Environmental Protection. At the meeting Monday morning between parents and school district officials, parents demanded that the inside of lockers be included as part of the asbestos cleanup. This additional step in the asbestos inspection process prompted the school's closure Tuesday. A Monday statement by the Business Office of Montclair Public Schools said that the Renaissance School would remain closed Tuesday for sixth and seventh grade students \"so that an extensive cleanup and additional asbestos testing can be completed\". Eighth grade students did not have classes scheduled as a trip to Washington, D.C. had previously been planned; the school trip is unaffected by the recent asbestos incident.Steve Jaraczewski of Detail Associates was present at the district meeting Monday, and said that one of four test samples taken at the school was positive for the presence of airborne asbestos at over six times acceptable levels. Jaraczewski was critical of the asbestos management plan provided by Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark, which owns the school's building and leases it to Montclair Public Schools.Jaraczewski said that the state Department of Environmental Protection has required asbestos management plans since 1988, but that the company that drafted the asbestos plan for the Archdiocese of Newark is out of business. Representative for the archdiocese Jim Goodness emphasized that the building would be back open for classes soon. \"The kids will be able to go back to school soon, and that's the important part,\" said Goodness.Exposure to airborne asbestos can lead to mesothelioma, a cancer which develops in the sac surrounding the lungs and chest cavity, abdominal cavity, or the sac surrounding the heart. Exposure to disturbed asbestos fibers can also lead to lung scarring, a condition called asbestosis, and lung cancer. Patients with malignant mesothelioma generally do not have positive outcomes, and once diagnosed have six months to a year to live.",

        "targetParagraphs": "New York Times: Two years after a former agent for the F.B.I. disappeared while on a trip to Iran, American diplomats and investigators are intensifying their efforts to resolve his case.The New York Times By BARRY MEIER Published: April 12, 2009 ImageTwo years after a former agent for the F.B.I. disappeared while on a trip to Iran, American diplomats and investigators are intensifying their efforts to resolve his case.Two weeks ago, an Obama administration envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, gave a letter to Iranian officials requesting information about the missing former agent, Robert Levinson, and two Americans imprisoned in Iran. Over the past year, a small team of F.B.I. agents, aided by consultants and businessmen with contacts in Iran, has also been seeking information about him.The efforts come at a delicate time in American-Iranian relations. The Obama administration is seeking greater engagement with Iran, even as the government there has announced that it will try one of the imprisoned Americans, Roxana Saberi, a freelance journalist, on espionage charges.Mr. Levinson disappeared in March 2007 on Kish Island, a Persian Gulf resort that is also a smuggling hub. His family has said that the former agent, who has worked in recent years as a private investigator, went there in connection with a cigarette smuggling case.On Kish, he met with another American, Dawud Salahuddin, who fled to Tehran in 1980 after killing an associate of the former shah of Iran in Maryland. Mr. Levinson was last seen checking out of a hotel on Kish and getting into a taxi to the airport.Since that day, even the basic question of whether Mr. Levinson is alive remains unresolved.One businessman who is assisting the F.B.I. in its inquiry said in a brief telephone interview that it was his understanding that Mr. Levinson was alive, a view that F.B.I. agents involved in the case share, said several people who had spoken with them. That businessman, like several other people interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to disrupt efforts to resolve the case.In a recent interview, a top F.B.I. official said the agency had received several unconfirmed reports of sightings of Mr. Levinson in Iran. But the official, Joseph Persichini Jr., said the inquiry had yet to produce evidence to prove that Mr. Levinson was alive. \u201cSome of those reports were detailed and sound credible, and we need to resolve that,\u201d said Mr. Persichini, the assistant director in charge of the F.B.I.\u2019s Washington field office, which is conducting the investigation.Some American lawmakers have said they believe that Mr. Levinson is being held in an Iranian prison. An expatriate Iranian businessman said his contacts in Iran had told him that Mr. Levinson was held for a time at a site near Tehran run by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard.Government officials there have repeatedly said that they know nothing about Mr. Levinson. An official in the Iranian president\u2019s office and a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry both refused to comment about the case on Saturday.Because no group has said it is holding Mr. Levinson, some people familiar with his case have speculated that he may have died in captivity. But others believe that the silence surrounding his status could suggest that because of his F.B.I. background, his captors view him as a high-value chip in a possible prisoner swap.\u201cI am confident he is alive,\u201d said David L. McGee, a lawyer in Pensacola, Fla., who represents the Levinson family.Mr. Levinson, who turned 59 a day after his disappearance, lived in Coral Springs, Fla., 20 miles north of Fort Lauderdale. For his wife, Christine Levinson, and their seven children, ages 15 to 31, the past two years have been an excruciating ordeal. Their hopes have soared and then plummeted amid conflicting reports about progress in his case. Last year, Mrs. Levinson traveled to Kish to retrace her husband\u2019s footsteps. She receives regular briefings from the F.B.I.\u201cThey just keep telling me they keep hearing that he is doing well,\u201d Mrs. Levinson said in a recent telephone interview. \u201cI have always believed that he is alive and well and somewhere in Iran, and that has not changed.\u201dMr. Levinson spent more than 20 years with the F.B.I. Before his retirement in 1998, he specialized in Russian organized crime cases. Most of his work as a private investigator involved product counterfeiting, though he also worked for human rights organizations.It was an assignment for one such organization, Global Witness, a London-based group that investigates corruption in natural resource industries, that took Mr. Levinson to Dubai in March 2007. After spending several days there, he next flew to Kish for his meeting with Mr. Salahuddin.Mr. Salahuddin\u2019s involvement has added another mystery to the case. While he has been quoted in news reports as saying that the killing he carried out in 1980 was necessary to eliminate enemies of Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic revolution, he has also criticized some of Iran\u2019s recent leaders and once flirted with the possibility of surrendering and returning to the United States. Mr. Salahuddin did not respond to recent e-mail messages seeking comment.Jeffrey Katz, the head of a London-based investigative firm for which Mr. Levinson did some work, said that he and other friends of the former agent believed that the F.B.I. was initially slow to devote sufficient resources to the case. An agency spokesman, John Jay Miller, disputed such suggestions.The Levinson case has received more attention since President Obama\u2019s election. Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida and a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, has been urging the F.B.I. and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to make resolving Mr. Levinson\u2019s case a priority.",

        "targetParagraphs": "A study published this month in Journal of Primary Health Care by researchers at the School of Population Health, University of Auckland found a correlation between adolescent obesity amongst Pacific Islanders (PI) living in New Zealand and church attendance. The results were based on interviews with 2,495 Auckland teenagers attending six different secondary schools, questionnaires given to students, and anthropometric measurements such as body mass index.While the percentage of non-churchgoing overweight \u2014 as opposed to normal or obese \u2014 adolescents was the same as churchgoing for Samoans and Cook Island Maori, 1% higher for \"other PI\" and 7% higher for Tongans, the rate of obese churchgoing adolescents was higher across all groups. Samoan churchgoing teens had an obese percentage of 38% compared to 35% for their non-churchgoing peers. For Cook Island Maori, it was 29% compared to 23%; for Tongans, 37% to 29%; for other PI, 31% to 29%.The study sought to examine different factors between churchgoing and non-churchgoing populations, finding that Samoan and Tongan churchgoers were more likely than non-churchgoers to have watched four or more hours of television or DVDs on the previous Saturday night. On the last Sunday night, non-churchgoers were more likely to have watched four or more hours across all groups, but the total percentages for churchgoers increased compared to Saturday; particularly, while only 13% of Cook Island Maori and other PI watched four or more hours on Saturday, 30% watched four or more hours on Sunday.Researchers also found that across all PI groups, non-churchgoing teens were more likely to have less than one serving of fruit a day and were a bit more likely to not eat lunch. With the exception of other PI, non-churchgoing teens were also more likely to rarely eat pies, fast food, and fried food compared to their churchgoing peers. Samoan churchgoers were also statistically more likely to consume soft drinks than their non-churchgoing peers.The work by Ofa A. Dewes, Robert Scragg, and C. Raina Elley built on existing research regarding obesity in PI communities, and other global studies that have found higher rates of obesity in churchgoing populations. They claim their research in this area is important because as an ethnic group, PI had the highest rates of childhood and adult obesity.",

No\u00ebl Rakotonandrasana, a leader of the restive troops, claimed wide support within the army and told reporters on Monday that \u201c75 percent of soldiers are with us,\u201d Reuters reported. He was flanked by other officers, but it was impossible to gauge the extent of the military\u2019s defiance.There were rumors that the camp was about to come under attack by troops loyal to the government. Mutinying soldiers were deployed at a roadblock that limited access to the base. Some said their disobedience was rooted in a refusal to take up arms against their countrymen.\u201cWe were trained to protect property and citizens, not to fire at the people,\u201d one of the men told Agence France-Presse.In recent weeks, mass demonstrations against the government have become common events, including a protest that left at least 28 people dead on Feb. 7 after the presidential guard opened fire on a crowd near one of the presidential palaces.The political conflict involves a rivalry between Mr. Ravalomanana, a wealthy businessman who took office after elections in 2001, and Andry Rajoelina, a media magnate and former disc jockey who was elected mayor of the capital in December 2007 and has of late denounced the president as a dictator insensitive to the needs of the nation. More than 100 people have died in civil unrest this year.At a Jan. 31 rally, Mr. Rajoelina proclaimed that he was in charge of the nation, in effect declaring a coup. In response, President Ravalomanana fired his rival as the capital\u2019s mayor. Representatives from both the United Nations and the African Union have unsuccessfully tried to mediate.On Friday, security officers went to Mr. Rajoelina\u2019s home in an effort to arrest him.

        "targetParagraphs": "A detainee on hunger strike at Guant\u00e1namo Bay has accused officials of a sudden change in practice that could result in him starving to death.IKONOS satellite image of a facility near Kabul<br>An IKONOS satellite image of a facility near Kabul, Afghanistan taken on July 17, 2003. A Washington Post on November 2, 2005 refers to this facility as the largest CIA covert prison in Afghanistan, code-named the Salt Pit.Inside the CIA\u2019s black site torture room Khalid Qasim, held at the prison for 15 years without charge or trial, told his lawyer that doctors stopped force-feeding him and another inmate three weeks ago, and are no longer monitoring their medical condition.\u201cThey have decided to leave us to waste away and die instead,\u201d Qasim, 40, told his lawyer by phone for an article published by the Guardian. \u201cI am in so much pain every minute that I know it can\u2019t go on much longer. Now as each night comes, I wonder if I will wake up in the morning. When will my organs fail? When will my heart stop? I am slowly slipping away and no one notices.\u201dBarack Obama tried and failed to close the prison at Guant\u00e1namo, a US naval station on the south-east corner of Cuba. Donald Trump has vowed to keep it open and \u201cload it up with some bad dudes\u201d. Of the 41 men still held there, 26 are dubbed \u201cforever prisoners\u201d \u2013 never to be released. At least four have been on hunger strike since 2013, claiming it as the sole peaceful protest open to them.Shelby Sullivan-Bennis, a lawyer at the human rights group Reprieve, which represents eight detainees, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the only control they have over their own lives. Khalid has used the word \u2018dignity\u2019 to reference to why he hunger strikes.\u201dStrikers who suffer chronic weight loss are typically force-fed twice a day by being strapped into a restraint chair and having a supplement poured through their noses via a very thin tube. Qasim and another inmate, Ahmed Rabbani, have gone without food since 20 September, according to Reprieve and other sources.Sullivan-Bennis said: \u201cIn calls with three or four of our clients, we learned the new senior medical officer said this policy would no longer continue and any harm to inmates \u2018was their own choice\u2019.\u201dThe Pentagon insists that an 11-year-old military policy allowing the involuntary feeding of detainees remains in place, although a spokesman did confirm some shift in approach, indicating a change in the medical conditions that require force-feeding.Major Ben Sakrisson, a spokesman, said: \u201cThere has not been a change in policy. Existing policy is just being reinforced with our personnel.In some instances in the past, attempts to provide detainees who claimed that they were on hunger strike with a measure of dignity through voluntary enteral feedings unintentionally created a situation that potentially encouraged future hunger strikes. As a result, the pre-existing standard of medical necessity will be enforced in the future.\u201dAccording to Reprieve, Qasim, from a small town in Yemen, travelled to Afghanistan in search of work in 2000. He was detained by Afghan police and handed over to US forces in a case of mistaken identity.He has spent most of his adult life in Guant\u00e1namo, finding consolation in painting and poetry that often reflect on his predicament. He mixed glue with gravel from the yard where detainees play football to create a three dimensional piece. He turned cloth from his shirt and pillow into a canvas on which he painted a cracked vase \u2013 later adding the date of Trump\u2019s inauguration.Sullivan-Bennis said: \u201cSomeone I spoke to said that, before this, he was the happiest he had been in the past three years. The art gives him an ability to express himself and have a sense of pride.\u201dBut when Sullivan-Bennis talked to Qasim by phone on 5 October, he sounded despondent. \u201cWe usually start with banter like \u2018How are you?\u2019, \u2018How are the family?\u2019 and something about his artwork. We didn\u2019t talk about his artwork for the first time I remember. When I asked, \u2018How are you?\u2019, his first words were, \u2018Very bad\u2019.\u201dQasim reported that in recent weeks he had not been weighed and not had his blood pressure taken. On one occasion he passed out but did not receive treatment. \u201cThese days have been the most terrifying of my 15 years in this place,\u201d he told the lawyer. \u201cWe are used to torture here but this is so slow and so cruel.\u201dSullivan-Bennis is worried that he will suffer organ damage but doubts that the US military would risk a fatality. She added: \u201cWe\u2019re at a crossroads. It seems quite obvious to us there has been a significant change and it does seem to be a new regime of medical neglect as punishment to quash the strike. Frankly it seems obvious they are breaching their own standard operating procedure.\u201dClive Stafford Smith, founder of Reprieve, wrote on its website that Rabbani now reportedly weighs just 6.7 stone (95lb) and has long suffered internal bleeding.He quoted Rabbani as saying: \u201cI don\u2019t want to die, but after four years of peaceful protest I am hardly going to stop because they tell me to. I will definitely stop when President Trump frees the prisoners who have been cleared, and allows everyone else a fair trial.\u201dHuman rights lawyers have long condemned force-feeding as a form of torture but they also oppose the way it is being suspended while their clients remain in legal limbo.Jeremy Varon, an organiser with the campaign group Witness Against Torture, said: \u201cFor years the military has been trying to find ways of discouraging people from participating in hunger strikes. Of course this is condemnable. They shouldn\u2019t be there in the first place. Everything that follows is on the side of morally reprehensible.\u201d",

(AP) \u0097 Brian Gay is doing his best to score a wire-to-wire victory in the St. Jude Classic.Gay shot a second consecutive four-under-par 66 on Saturday to keep the lead by a stroke over Bryce Molder after the third round at the T.P.C. Southwind.A victory will earn Gay a place in the United States Open, which begins Thursday at Bethpage on Long Island. He won at Hilton Head in April and can earn the berth with a second win this year.Gay has just five bogeys in three rounds, and his only one Saturday came on the 18th after his second shot from a fairway bunker hit the water. That dropped him to 14-under 196.For someone who expected to be off next week after he missed qualifying by three strokes, Gay said he was not thinking about the Open yet.\u201cNot till you mention it,\u201d he said. \u201cNot really. Not when I\u2019m out there, I don\u2019t think about it. I mean it\u2019s a major. I\u2019d love to play in it. I expected to be off next week.\u201dHe added: \u201cI\u2019ve got enough work to do here to not have to worry about that. Nothing I need to think about.\u201dPhil Mickelson shot a 68 and was 10 shots back at 206 in his first event since announcing his wife\u2019s diagnosis of breast cancer. He still was not happy with his putter.Brian Gay, hitting out of a bunker on the ninth, leads Bryce Molder by a stroke after the third round of the St. Jude Classic.\u201cI haven\u2019t putted well the first three days,\u201d Mickelson said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve struck the ball well but have not been able to get it in the hole and shoot a number, a good low number and mostly because of the putter. I\u2019ll spend some time on that in the next few days and should be able to get it ironed out for next week.\u201dJohn Daly\u2019s comeback to the PGA Tour stretched into the weekend as he made the cut in this storm-delayed event on the line at even par. He shot a 71 in the third round and was one over.Robert Allenby (68) was alone in third at 199, followed by Paul Goydos (64). Woody Austin (68) was in a group tied for fifth at 201.Gay came into this event among seven players who had a chance to earn a spot in the field at Bethpage with a victory. He won at Hilton Head by 10 strokes but insists that was not his goal here.He has led by a stroke after each of the first three rounds. He had five birdies Saturday and went as low as 15 under, ahead by as many as three strokes.His putting has been the key. He followed up 23 putts in the second round with 24. Gay has had 73 putts through 54 holes, but Molder and Allenby have played almost as well.Molder, a Nationwide Tour qualifier, is not ready to give up a chance at what would be his first PGA Tour victory. His best finish was third in Reno, Nev., in 2001.\u201cThe golf ball doesn\u2019t know about the history of either one of us, so just go play,\u201d Molder said.Gay and Molder avoided having to return Saturday morning to wrap up the second round, which was stopped Friday because of a storm that took down part of a tree near the 15th hole.A forecast of more storms expected Sunday afternoon caused organizers to move up tee times for the final round and send threesomes off the front and back tees.",

        "targetParagraphs": "A few clues that the U.S. economy\u2019s downward spiral might be slowing galvanized Wall Street on Thursday and sent the stock market soaring for the second time this week.Investors searching for relief from a relentless march of bad economic news found wisps of hope in developments that, not many months ago, would have been regarded as alarming. The news, by and large, was bad \u2014 just not quite as bad as feared.General Electric, the blue-chip corporation, was stripped of its triple-A credit rating, an emblem of business prowess it proudly held since 1956. But its rating fell just one notch, less than some analysts predicted. Shares of GE soared 13 percent.The Commerce Department reported that retail sales fell slightly in February \u2014 again, less than forecast. And the head of the beleaguered Bank of America said the lender probably would not need more government money but other banks might.Less-bad was good enough. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 239.66 points, or 3.46 percent, to 7,170.06, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index leaped 29.38 points, or 4.07 percent, to 750.74.Since Monday, when the market fell to its lowest point in 12 years, stock indexes have soared roughly 10 percent, their best run since November. But few experts were willing to call an end to the bear market, which has cut the Dow in half since its peak October 2007.Indeed, many analysts predicted that this rally, like others before it, will fizzle before the market stages a lasting recovery. Economists cautioned that the economy was not about to turn a corner anytime soon, even though the numbers suggested that consumers were not entirely in a bunker mentality.But some saw signs of a subtle shift in investor psychology, a willingness to believe, even for a few days, that Wall Street\u2019s worst fears might be overblown.\u201cWhen the markets have been battered as much as they have, any little shred of positive news is greeted with great cheer,\u201d said Marc D. Stern, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, an investment firm in New York.The stock market, Stern said, seems to be entering a new phase, in which investors reconsider their despairing views about the economy and corporate profits. He said the market could fall again, though he does not expect as many \u201csharp free falls.\u201d Usually the stock market starts trending higher before the economy recovers.News that the ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s cut GE\u2019s credit rating one notch calmed fears that the giant company would be toppled by the potential losses in its finance arm. GE, the report concluded, is not a deeply troubled bank in disguise. \u201cWe believe,\u201d it said, \u201cthat GE\u2019s cash generation capabilities remain fundamentally strong \u2014 even in the face of enormous global economic headwinds.\u201dBank of America rose 19 percent. Other financial shares also rose. The S&P 500 Financial Index rallied 10 percent, bringing its gain for the week to 33 percent.Stocks opened lower, reflecting early weakness in overseas markets, but by 10 a.m. the market was in positive territory.",

        "targetParagraphs": "The scientific journal RNA Biology will require authors of articles in a new section on RNA families to submit summaries of their work to Wikipedia, Nature News reports.Since 2007, the RNA family database (Rfam) has been synchronized with Wikipedia, so that editing Wikipedia alters the database. A small core group of scientists updates the entries in Wikipedia, but a long tail of scientists and other Wikipedians have contributed as well. Due to the scientific nature of the entries, vandalism has not been a large problem, according to Sean Eddy, a computational biologist at the Janelia Farm Research Campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Ashburn, Virginia.\"The novelty is that for the first time it creates a link between Wikipedia and traditional journal publishing, with its peer-review element,\" Alex Bateman from the Rfam database told Nature News. This way, scientists are encouraged to submit to Wikipedia, while they are rewarded with a citable publication in a peer review journal (which in turn drives their funding). In the interview with Nature, the journal's editor expressed her hopes that other journals would adopt the model.The new Wikipedia entry will be peer reviewed separately before it is published on Wikipedia. The first article in the new journal section will deal with SmY RNA, a family which now has its own Wikipedia article. According to the online version of the article, it was submitted on November 21, 2008, and accepted five days later. The Wikipedia article was moved from the userpage of one of the co-authors to the article section one day before submission.In an accompanying editorial, the new Associate Editor-in-Chief of the new section, Paul P. Gardner, explained: \"...A Wikipedia entry is usually among the top few hits from a Google search with a molecular biology keyword. Therefore, we would like to ensure that the RNA relevant information in Wikipedia is both reliable and current. We think that this track will provide an important mechanism by which time will be spent by experts to improve the record.\"The author guidelines for this new section contain a mini-guide for the scientists to publishing their first Wikipedia article, mostly from a technical aspect (explaining syntax) rather than as a style guide.In the field of molecular biology, wiki technology is increasingly being used. For example, two biochemists and Wikipedians, Professor William J. Wedemeyer and Tim Vickers, MSc, PhD, hosted a Wikipedia workshop last Tuesday at the American Society for Cell Biology Annual Meeting.The Wiki approach is not met with undivided enthusiasm; last March, 250 scientists wrote a petition in the magazine Science to ask GenBank to allow community annotation of its DNA sequences, but their request to 'Wikify' GenBank was denied.In an e-mail to Wikinews and on the Nature website, Prof. Wedemeyer called the new initiative a \"promising method for outreach, connecting the scientific world with the public that usually pays for the research,\" by \"centralizing public outreach in the widely read Wikipedia.\" He said that the initiative \"seems likely to be effective.\"",

        "targetParagraphs": "The Football Association of England risked a backlash and possible disciplinary action from football's world governing body FIFA on Tuesday when it rescinded the suspensions due from red cards that had been given during the past weekend's matches to FA Premier League players Andrew Welsh of Sunderland and Paul Konchesky of West Ham United.The FA's decision permitted Welsh to play for the Black Cats in their 2-1 loss at home to Manchester City Tuesday evening. Konchesky will also be available for the Hammers' next game on Saturday when West Ham host Bolton Wanderers. However, the FA's actions contravene FIFA regulations, which demand that any player sent off be suspended for his team's next match, with no right of appeal except for mistaken identity.FIFA House had already been in contact with Soho Square over the past week after the FA downgraded a red card that had been given to Newcastle United's Jermaine Jenas to a yellow card on the advice of referee Steve Bennett. The FA had indicated it would eventually issue a reply to FIFA, but the decision to overturn two more cards less than a week after the FIFA communication is likely to displease FIFA president Sepp Blatter.For the past three years especially, Blatter has been adamant that a red card in a football match must result in the player who was sent off missing his team's next game in the same competition. Blatter has clashed with the FA on this issue during that time, going so far as to threaten the English association with expulsion from FIFA. As a result, the FA agreed in 2004 to change their disciplinary process, in particular ensuring the process was expedited so that a player who was sent off did indeed miss his next match. However, it is now apparent that the FA has chosen to also allow for expedited appeals of red cards on grounds other than mistaken identity, which is not provided for in the FIFA regulations.Although the FA has now permitted Jenas, Welsh and Konchesky to play after being sent off in a previous match, it also extended an automatic three-match ban imposed on Southend United's Freddy Eastwood by one additional match after its disciplinary panel deemed his appeal of a red card received the previous weekend to be \"frivolous.\" The FA also rejected the appeal of Luton Town's Steve Howard, but did not extend his three-match suspension.Unlike with Jenas, the red cards issued to Welsh and Konchesky will remain on their disciplinary records because the referees involved did not agree that they made mistakes. This means they will still receive an additional one-match ban should they be sent off again this season. Following Tuesday's decisions, half of the six red cards shown in the Premiership this season have been overturned. And in an interesting footnote, it was Jenas who Konchesky was sent off for fouling this past weekend.",

The chief of the Internal Affairs Ministry said that pending DNA tests, he could not confirm the identity of three bodies, believed to be those of Mr. Sadyrkulov and his guards, that were found in an incinerated Lexus S.U.V. that had been hit by an Audi sedan.An opposition politician said that in recent weeks, Mr. Sadyrkulov had been raising money in Kazakhstan to help overthrow the Kyrgyz president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev.Mr. Sadyrkulov oversaw widely criticized parliamentary elections in December 2007 that solidified the rule of President Bakiyev, but several opposition politicians said that he had recently expressed regret for his actions and had said he wanted to join the opposition for ideological reasons.\u201cHe was not only frustrated with this government, but also sad that he helped Bakiyev to strengthen his power,\u201d said Omurbek Tekebayev, a former speaker of Parliament and head of an opposition party. \u201cHe said that it was now his obligation to help correct the problems that he had created.\u201dMr. Tekebayev and other politicians accused the president\u2019s family of engineering Mr. Sadyrkulov\u2019s death.Mr. Sadyrkulov had been in charge of the president\u2019s cabinet and had been Mr. Bakiyev\u2019s primary negotiator.

        "targetParagraphs": "WASHINGTON \u0097 President Obama on Sunday praised the energy bill passed by the House late last week as an \u201cextraordinary first step,\u201d but he spoke out against a provision that would impose trade penalties on countries that do not accept limits on global warming pollution.\u201cAt a time when the economy worldwide is still deep in recession and we\u2019ve seen a significant drop in global trade,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cI think we have to be very careful about sending any protectionist signals out there.\u201dHe added, \u201cI think there may be other ways of doing it than with a tariff approach.\u201dThe passage of the House bill on Friday night was an important, if tentative, victory for the president, becoming the first time either chamber of Congress had approved a mandatory ceiling on the gases linked to global warming.Mr. Obama, hoping to build momentum in the Senate after the narrow victory in the House, delayed the start of a Sunday golf game to speak to a small group of reporters in the Oval Office.He acknowledged that the initial targets for reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases set by the House bill were quite modest and would probably not satisfy the governments of other countries or many environmental groups. But he said he hoped to build on those early targets in fashioning a more robust program in the future as part of his administration\u2019s efforts to move the nation from an economy based on fossil fuels toward one built on renewable energy sources.Mr. Obama predicted that similar energy legislation would face a difficult slog through the Senate and require months of tough negotiations and additional compromises. The horse-trading and vote-buying that helped House leaders secure a 219-to-212 victory will be magnified in the Senate, where several powerful committee leaders are already asserting authority and Democratic moderates hold more power than their counterparts in the House.Politics Across the United States A Divide Over Abortion: Across the country, fractures are emerging among conservative and centrist women, as they confront a steady drumbeat of new abortion restrictions and court rulings.A Prosecutor Under Pressure: Mary Moriarty, the top prosecutor in Minneapolis, promised an overhaul after the murder of George Floyd. Now she faces criticism, including from fellow Democrats.Fierce Races in Wisconsin: For more than a decade, the state\u2019s legislative maps helped Republicans hold power. New maps are expected to return many races to the realm of true competition.Follow our coverage of the 2024 election here.Mr. Obama set no timetable for Senate action but exhorted its leadership to take the House bill as a benchmark and \u201cseize the day.\u201dThe president used the interview to put the House vote in the context of his broader efforts to modernize the American economy by shifting to cleaner and more efficient forms of energy.He said the House bill was a \u201ccomprehensive approach\u201d that included a cap-and-trade program to limit heat-trapping gas emissions, incentives for new energy efficiency measures and support for wind and solar energy as well as nuclear power and so-called clean coal technology.He said that those measures, combined with the administration\u2019s new automobile mileage standards and stimulus spending on research and home weatherization, represented a sea change in American energy policy.\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that over the first six months we\u2019ve seen more action on shifting ourselves away from dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels than at any time in several decades,\u201d Mr. Obama said.Mr. Obama linked the energy and health care fights, saying that major revisions in both were necessary because \u201ceverybody knows what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t working.\u201d\u201cThe status quo is unacceptable,\u201d he said.As he has done in the health care discussions, Mr. Obama refused to deliver definitive judgments on specific provisions of the energy bill, leaving the legislative wrangling to members of Congress. But he said his bottom line for energy and climate change legislation included meaningful reductions in heat-trapping gas emissions, strong incentives for energy efficiency, protections for consumers and businesses against spikes in energy costs, and deficit neutrality.\u201cIf it meets those broad criteria,\u201d he said, \u201cthen it\u2019s a bill I want to embrace.\u201dThe House bill contains a provision, inserted in the middle of the night before the vote Friday, that requires the president, starting in 2020, to impose a \u201cborder adjustment\u201d \u0097 or tariff \u0097 on certain goods from countries that do not act to limit their global warming emissions. The president can waive the tariffs only if he receives explicit permission from Congress.The provision was added to secure the votes of Rust Belt lawmakers who were wavering on the bill because of fears of job losses in heavy industry.In the floor debate on the bill Friday, one of its authors, Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said, \u201cAs we act, we can and must ensure that the U.S. energy-intensive industries are not placed at a competitive disadvantage by nations that have not made a similar commitment to reduce greenhouse gases.\u201dIn the interview on Sunday, Mr. Obama said American industries like steel, aluminum, paper and glass had legitimate concerns about competition from developing nations. But he warned that trade sanctions based on the extent to which other countries curbed carbon dioxide emissions might be illegal and counterproductive.Mr. Obama has sometimes sent mixed signals about his attitude toward free trade. In the Democratic presidential primary, he was fiercely critical of several free trade agreements with China, Caribbean countries and Mexico for failing to include strict enough environmental standards. He argued that the United States should threaten to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement to renegotiate protections for the environment as well as workers\u2019 rights.But as president, Mr. Obama has not made a priority of renegotiating Nafta or other trade agreements. And he has always indicated that though he favors adjusting some rules, he supports the principle of free trade.In the interview, Mr. Obama had few words of comfort for those who may have taken a political risk by voting for the House climate change bill, and no threats for the 44 House Democrats who defied their leadership to oppose it.\u201cI think those 44 Democrats are sensitive to the immediate political climate of uncertainty around this issue,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to run every two years, and I completely understand that.\u201dMany of the Democrats who voted against the legislation represent districts that rely heavily on coal for electricity and manufacturing for jobs.Mr. Obama said the House bill contained transitional assistance for these regions.But he expressed scorn for the Republicans who fought the bill in the House. He noted that some of them had predicted political doom for those who voted for it, recalling the 1993 battle over an energy tax that failed and helped Republicans gain control of the House a year later.Those Republicans \u201care 16 years behind the times,\u201d he said, comparing their position to that of Republican leaders in the energy and health care debates of the early Clinton years.\u201cThey\u2019re fighting not even the last war,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re fighting three wars ago.\u201d",

It comes a day after its forces gained control of Kaniguram, another key Taliban stronghold, which the military says its forces have now completely secured.According to the military, 21 militants and one Pakistani soldier died in the past 24 hours of fighting -- most of them in the raid on Sararogha. The military is trying to rout Taliban insurgents operating along the Pakistan-Afghan border.The restive and largely ungoverned region of South Waziristan is the headquarters of the Pakistani Taliban.Pakistan's military suspects its leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, is still in the region backed by up to 8,000 militant fighters.Pakistan's army has launched three similar offensives in Kaniguram and Sararogha since 2004 without success, sometimes agreeing to peace deals that eventually fall apart.Army spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas recently told CNN that this time a peace deal is not an option.\"Certainly there is no scope of a peace deal,\" Abbas told CNN. \"It is a fight to the finish.\"The military began its ground offensive in South Waziristan three weeks ago, however the region has been affected by a broader anti-Taliban offensive that has uprooted more than 180,000 people this year, according to the United Nations. Many of those people -- more than 94,000 -- have fled South Waziristan since June, the U.N. said last week.In recent weeks, Pakistan has been relentlessly rocked by a wave of attacks as Islamic militants retaliate against the military campaign.On Monday, the Pakistani cities of Lahore and Rawalpindi were hit by separate suicide bombings. A suicide attacker believed to be on a motorcycle targeted people outside a bank in Rawalpindi who were lined up to pick up their monthly checks, police said. That attack killed 30 people, police said on Tuesday.The attack happened in the Cannt area of Rawalpindi, close to Pakistan's military headquarters where the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, was meeting with Pakistan's army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani on Monday. It was unclear if he was there at the time of the attack.Hours later, two suicide bombers detonated their explosives at a police checkpoint in Lahore, injuring 17 police and civilians.",

        "targetParagraphs": "At 23:18:55 GMT this evening, a Russian Proton-M/Briz-M rocket launched from Area 200/39 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, with the AMC-14 satellite for American communications organisation SES Americom. The rocket, operated by International Launch Services (ILS), lifted off on time, and headed towards a Geosynchronous orbit. Around forty minutes after lift-off, ILS reported that an anomaly had occurred during the second burn of the upper stage. AMC-14, which would have been operated in conjunction with Echostar was to provide direct-to-home satellite television services. It was based on the Lockheed Martin A2100 satellite bus.This is the 11th orbital launch of 2008, and the first to fail. It is also the 334th launch of the Proton rocket, the 41st Proton launch failure, the 2,800th Russian orbital launch, and the 45th Proton launch to be conducted by ILS. It is also the third failure of a Proton during an ILS launch in as many years, following a malfunction during a launch last September, and another in February 2006.The Proton itself performed nominally, and the Briz-M upper stage successfully completed the first of three burns. During the second burn, however, an undisclosed malfunction occurred, leaving the satellite stranded in a much lower orbit than planned. It is unclear whether the satllite is recoverable. There are currently three options, which are to declare the satellite a write-off and de-orbit it, attempt to raise it to geosynchronous orbit under its own power, or propel it towards the Moon, using lunar gravity to slingshot it back into the correct orbit. If either of the latter options are chosen, it will be at great cost to the satellite's on-orbit life expectancy.",

        "targetParagraphs": "Automotive executives from General Motors and Chrysler defended their decision to shut down 2,000 dealerships across the country, telling a panel of skeptical lawmakers on Friday that the cull was necessary to their restructuring and survival.\u201cThis is our last chance,\u201d Fritz Henderson, chief executive of G.M., said during a hearing in Washington. \u201cWe cannot undergo this sweeping transformation without a comparable effort to remake our retail network.\u201dThe struggling automakers say their large dealer networks are a relic of rapid expansion from five decades ago, and that they now represent a drain on the companies. Chrysler and G.M. argue that they can save billions on support costs, incentive payments and other costs by closing dealerships that perform poorly or do not fit restructuring plans.\u201cThis has been the most difficult business action I\u2019ve ever personally taken,\u201d said James E. Press, president of Chrysler, which won court approval this week to shut down 789 dealers. \u201cToday\u2019s automotive industry cannot support the number of dealers currently in the marketplace.\u201dTheir position drew considerable fire.Auto dealers have traveled to Washington to protest the planned closings, and lawmakers on the House Energy Committee\u2019s oversight subcommittee said closing so many dealerships would eliminate tens of thousands of jobs, hurt local economies and do little to improve the automakers\u2019 long-term prospects.\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the impact on people\u2019s lives in every Congressional district in this country,\u201d said Representative Bruce L. Braley, Democrat of Iowa. \u201cIt\u2019s much broader than the loss of sales and service. It\u2019s part of the fabric of this country.\u201dIn what could be a critical test of the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to remake the auto industry, House lawmakers have introduced a bill to restore franchise agreements between Chrysler, General Motors and their dealers. Some senators have urged Chrysler to let their dealers appeal the closures.Chrysler does not have an appeals process for dealers affected by the closings, but G.M. said it had heard 856 appeals and granted 45.In sometimes emotional testimony on Friday, car dealers spoke of their connection to their communities, recalled how they supported little leagues and local nonprofit agencies and had operated businesses that had been in their families for generations. And they criticized what they called abrupt and unfair closures.\u201cIn a period of 24 hours, my business was essentially taken from me with no real explanation other than, \u2018These are difficult times,\u2019 \u201d said Frank Blankenbecker, who owns Carlisle Chevrolet in Waxahachie, Tex. \u201cThis makes no sense. Why is this happening?\u201dIt is not just dealerships that are closing. Chrysler and G.M. have announced plant closings around the country as they try to cut costs and readjust to a shrinking market. With the economy mired in recession, auto sales in the United States fell to fewer than 10 million a year, from a high of 17 million in 2005.After years of losses and billions of dollars in government aid, the automakers still face an uncertain fate. Chrysler emerged this week from 42-day trip through bankruptcy court after forging an alliance with the Italian automaker Fiat, and General Motors is restructuring in Chapter 11 and selling pieces of itself, including its Hummer and Saturn brands and the Opel unit.",

If the talks fail, the strike would be first strike of its kind since 1984. The strike was called due to the growing issue of unpaid wages. The disagreement rises from Spain's bankruptcy laws, which allow for the payment of wages to be delayed like any other debt. Six teams in Spain's top flight are currently bankrupt and owe over 200 players close to US$72 million.Spain's footballers will go on strike from Friday to Monday, canceling the start of both the first and second divisions. Top clubs, Barcelona and Real Madrid will be the high profile casualties of this postponement. There has been almost universal support for the strike with coaches and players of many clubs supporting the strike. Barcelona forward David Villa said: \"We have made clear that all the players support the players' association, if a solution is not found, we won't play.\" When Mallorca coach Michael Laudrup was asked to comment, he made his stance clear by saying \"I think it's ok what the players are doing now,\" pointing to the discrepancies between the riches of Barcelona, Real Madrid and the rest of Spanish football.Espanyol captain Luis Garc\u00eda told El Mundo Deportivo on Thursday that the time for all the players to unite had come and enough is enough. \"We aren't asking for more money - only that the contracts that have been signed are fulfilled. Either this is resolved once and for all or we don't play. We cannot continue like this,\" he added. H\u00e9rcules striker Tote echoed the players' position: \"If necessary, there will be no football in Spain throughout the whole year. If we have to maintain our stance until May, we will.\"\nReal Zaragoza striker Ikechukwu Uche told the BBC's African sports programme Fast Track: \"Not all the players are owed, but there is solidarity. I don't think the strike is good for anybody - it's not good for us, it's not good for the federation, it's not good for the fans. We had expected that we were going to start [the league] this weekend but we can't - they have to resolve the issues. Once they have resolved everything, then we will start.\"Further talks are expected to take place on Saturday and Monday.",

She had been suffering end-stage leukemia and dementia for months, and had been hospitalised in December. Her son, Donto James, said at the time that his mother was \"still fighting.\"\"We're all very sad,\" her doctor said on Friday. \"To know her, to know her past, I feel very blessed to have been able to take care of her.\" James's husband and sons were with her when she died.Her manager Lupe De Leon said: \"She was a true original \u2013 her music defied category. This is a tremendous loss for the family, her friends and fans around the world.\"\nJames's life was as eventful as her career, involving drug use and health problems, but she fed her troubles into her music.Her mother \u2013 described in her 1995 autobiography Rage to Survive as a scam artist \u2013 was a fleeting presence during her youth. She never knew her father, although she had been told he was the famous billiards player Minnesota Fats. They met when she was older and he neither confirmed nor denied the rumour.James was discovered by singer Johnny Otis, who died earlier this week. She scored her first hit in 1954 with Roll With Me Henry. James was just 15 at the time, and about to embark on a career that took in blues, gospel, soul, jazz and rock'n'roll.Known as \"Miss Peaches\", she joined Chess Records in 1960 and found a wider audience, although she never experienced huge commercial success. She later fought a heroin problem - saying in 1995 she tried the drug because \"I was trying to be cool\" \u2013 and in later years struggled with her weight, often performing from a wheelchair. In the early 2000s, she had weight-loss surgery.The 2008 film Cadillac Records was based on the Chess story, with James portrayed by Beyonc\u00e9. The relationship between the two singers wasn't always a smooth one, however. When Beyonc\u00e9 performed At last at Barack Obama's inaugural ball, James said she had \"no business singing my song that I've been singing forever\". She later retracted these comments, saying they were meant as a joke.James's voice, which could switch from tender to ferocious in an instant, inspired soul singers such as Amy Winehouse and Adele. The latter once claimed hearing James made her want to take up singing. When she eventually met her, Adele said she was starstruck: \"My mind went completely blank. I didn't know what to say. Afterwards, I was crying my eyes out.\"Donto James and his stepfather, Artis Mills, had been embroiled in a legal dispute over James's care and control of her $1m estate. Under a recent agreement with Donto James and his brother, Sametto James, Mills will remain as conservator of her estate. But a judge last month released only $350,000 for her medical costs, less than the $500,000 that Mills had requested.\nThe singer won six Grammy awards during her career and was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",

Security was stepped up in the Tibet Autonomous Region and border areas. The anniversary passed on Saturday without serious unrest.Bachug, the head of Tibet\u2019s tourism department, told Xinhua on Sunday that the region is \u201charmonious and safe now\u201d for tourists. Mr. Bachug, who like many Tibetans uses only one name, said more than 100 foreign tour groups have registered to visit Tibet.An uprising in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa March of last year led to the deaths of at least 19 people, most of them Han Chinese civilians. Hundreds of protesters were detained. Exile groups claim that 220 monks, nuns and other Tibetans died and more than 1,000 were injured in the ensuing crackdown.Determined to head off any renewed unrest this year, the government dispatched thousands of troops and police officers across western China, creating an unofficial state of martial law.YouTube was blocked for most of last week in China and again on Monday, apparently because of a video that purports to show the police brutally beating Tibetans after last year\u2019s riots. Without identifying the video, Xinhua reported that Tibetan separatists had fabricated a video of police misconduct.Foreign reporters are barred from Tibet, but the Chinese news media reported limited unrest over the past six weeks. In the most serious skirmish, nearly 100 people, most of them monks, were arrested in a Tibetan area of northwestern China after a crowd attacked a police station on March 21, authorities said. Chinese officials said 13,000 people in Lhasa celebrated Saturday, the anniversary of the day China took control of Tibet and forced its spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, into exile.

Estrada's son and co-accused, Senator Jose Estrada, was acquitted on both charges.The court also ordered the confiscation of several properties, including mansions, that Estrada acquired while in power, as well as hundreds of millions of pesos in two bank accounts. The court also ruled that Estrada was permanently disqualified from seeking public office.The plunder case stemmed from allegations that Estrada received more than $85 million in kickbacks from tobacco taxes, commissions from the purchase of shares by a government insurance fund, payoffs from illegal gambling operators, and for using a fictitious name in a bank account. The perjury case was for allegedly misstating his income and assets.\"I thought the rule of justice would prevail here, but it's really a kangaroo court,\" Estrada told reporters minutes after the verdict was read. \"I have always expected that this will happen,\" he added.Estrada, 70, has been in detention for more than six years now. He was ousted in an uprising in 2001 that arose from allegations of corruption, as well as accusations of womanizing and heavy drinking in the presidential palace.The charges deeply offended the Catholic Church, leading it to organize, along with so-called \"civil society\" groups and leftist organizations, massive demonstrations against Estrada. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who was Estrada's vice president, took over the presidency in 2001 after the military withdrew support for him amid growing public protests dubbed People Power II. The original People Power revolt removed former President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986. Estrada had been in office for only two years.Estrada, a former movie star who is hugely popular among the masses, has repeatedly denied the allegations against him, saying these were politically motivated. He accused the country's elite, the Catholic Church, and civil society groups for conspiring against him. The uprising, he claimed, was a power grab.Talking to reporters through a window at the courthouse after the verdict Wednesday, Estrada said he had hoped that, because an impeachment trial in Congress had been cut short by the \"People Power\" uprising, he could present his side at the Sandiganbayan. He said he had thought the court \"was the only forum where I can ventilate myself and tell the people of my innocence.\"",

Leonel Fernandez, leader of the neighboring Dominican Republic, was staying as a guest at the palace.The police reacted violently, resulting in 3 people being shot and wounded. Protestors had tried to block the motorcade of the Dominican president, which resulted in Haitian police firing shots into the air. UN representative David Wimhurst said UN peacekeepers were at the protests, but only Haitian police and bodyguards of the Dominican president fired shots. President Fernandez cut short his visit and most of the diplomatic staff withdrew from the country. The Dominican ambassador in Haiti demanded an apology for the incident.The protests were over alleged abuses of Haitian refugees in the Dominican Republic, an issue of importance to the relationship of the two countries in the past several months. In May the Dominican government deported at least 2,000 Haitian in response to murder of a Dominican woman. Earlier in December several Dominican villagers burned down settlements of Haitians in response for the death of a business man.Responding to the tensions that have arisen between citizens of the Dominican Republic and immigrants, President Fernandez said prior to his Haiti visit, \"\u2026 we must understand that the countries that share borders, mainly if they have unequal economic and social levels of development, historically usually have relations of conflicts.\"Provisional President Boniface Alexandre said that he hopes these talks could fuel better relations between the neighboring countries.

The book, \u201cVerisimilitude,\u201d was published in 2005 and reportedly sold fewer than a dozen copies.The case was brought under the country\u2019s strict l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws, which call for a prison term of up to 15 years for anyone who \u201cdefames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir to the throne or the regent.\u201dThe boundaries of the law are unclear, and cases can be brought by any citizen, involving a variety of alleged offenses. Dozens of cases are now pending. In addition, the government has closed more than 2,000 Web sites that it says include material insulting to the monarchy.Speaking to reporters before the verdict was announced, Mr. Nicolaides said he had endured \u201cunspeakable suffering\u201d during five months of detention.\u201cI would like to apologize,\u201d he added. \u201cThis can\u2019t be real.

        "targetParagraphs": "It\u2019s common wisdom. Near gospel really, and not just among young people and founders. Across generational lines, sentiments like those from Steve Jobs\u2019 2005 commencement at Stanford have been engraved into our collective consciousness: \n\"The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.\" \nIn other words, follow your passion. There\u2019s just one problem: \"\u2018Follow your passion\u2019 is dangerous advice.\" \nThat\u2019s a troubling claim, but it comes straight from Cal Newport\u2019s investigation into \"the details of how passionate people like Steve Jobs really got started\" as well as what scientists say predicts happiness and fuels great accomplishment. \nNewport\u2019s not alone. In recent years, a host of leaders, academics, and entrepreneurs have all come to the same startling conclusion: nearly everything you\u2019ve been told about following your passion is wrong. \nHere are seven habits you need instead. \nRyan Holiday, author of Ego Is the Enemy:\n\"Your passion may be the very thing holding you back from power or influence or accomplishment. Because just as often, we fail with \u2014 no, because of \u2014 passion. ... [P]urpose deemphasizes the I. Purpose is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to pleasuring yourself.\" \nUntil about a century ago, passion was a dirty word. Classical philosopher like Socrates and Marcus Aurelius saw passion as a liability not an asset: an insatiable and destructive force. Why? \nChiefly because passion is dangerously self-centered. In fact, our own modern descriptions of passion betray this inward bend: \"I want to [blank]. I need to [blank]. I have to [blank].\" In most cases, whatever word finishes those sentences \u2014 regardless of how well meaning it might be \u2014 is overshadowed by the first. \nPurpose, on the other hand, is about them, not me. It reorients our focus onto the people and causes we\u2019re trying to reach, serve, help, and love. In The Happiness Hypothesis, psychologist Jonathan Haidt describes this pursuit as a \"striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself. If you get these relationships right, a sense of purpose and meaning will emerge.\" \nPassion makes us bigger. Purpose connects us to something bigger and in doing so makes us right sized. \nShaa Wasmund, author of Stop Talking, Start Doing:\n\"\u2018No\u2019 is a far more powerful word than \u2018Yes.\u2019 Every \u2018Yes\u2019 said out of obligation or fear takes time away from the things and people we love. When an opportunity appears connected with your passion, it\u2019s even trickier. Instead of snatching up everything that might get your closer to the life you want, give yourself the space to pick carefully.\" \nGood is the enemy of great. That\u2019s how Jim Collins put it anyway. Learning to say \"No\" is easily one of the most vital skills we can cultivate. And yet, even if you\u2019ve mastered \"No\" to the obvious stuff, passion rears its head. \nThe blinding effect of passion leads us unthinkingly into projects and meetings that, in truth, are dead ends. Worse, they sap time and energy that would otherwise move us forward. When Tim Ferriss asked journalist Kara Swisher what message she\u2019d put on a billboard for millions to see, her answer was a single word, \"Stop.\" \nAnd that\u2019s what picking is all about: slow down, pause, evaluate, weigh, and only then make a clear-headed choice. Picking involves, first, putting a time buffer on our decisions, particularly decisions that appear \"connected with your passion.\" Second, running our choices by an objective third party: a friend or colleague who can call out our blind spots. \nSleep on it. Reach out. The sun will rise tomorrow. And be ruthless with your \"No\u2019s.\" \nAngela Duckworth, author of Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance:\n\"After you\u2019ve discovered and developed interest in a particular area, you must devote yourself to the sort of focused, full-hearted, challenge-exceeding-skill practice that leads to mastery. You must zero in on your weaknesses, and you must do so over and over again, for hours a day, week after month after year.\" \nWe all love shortcuts. The allure of getting more by doing less is seductive. But are there times when doing more equals more? Absolutely. \nThe classic illustration comes from David Bayles and Ted Orland\u2019s Art and Fear where a ceramics teacher divided his class into two groups. The first was told they\u2019d be graded on quality. The other, quantity. To get an A, the quantity group was required to produce fifty pounds of clay pots. Not exactly an artistically inspired assignment. And yet, when grading time came, \"a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.\" \nWhat accounted for this reversal of expectations? \nEasy: while the quality group held back \u2014 laboring under perfectionism \u2014 the quantity group got busy. They practiced. And that\u2019s good news. If greatness came down to passion \u2014 or worse, talent \u2014 then it\u2019d be reserved for only a select few. Practice means greatness is doable ... one tiny step after another. \nLiran Kotzer, CEO of Woo.io:\n\"Passion is indeed very important, but what most people don't know is what\u2019s needed to achieve their true potential. Whether it\u2019s to acquire new skills, get a promotion, or achieve what they want, it all starts with having a plan based on real data and real-world options.\" \nThe only word less sexy than practice is planning. And yet planning is a golden thread woven through the lives of artists, leaders, and entrepreneurs alike. The trick here is that plans need not be grandiose. Rather, they shouldn\u2019t be. \nOptimism is wonderful when it comes to our dreams. However, when it comes to what\u2019s next \u2014 the nitty-gritty actions that\u2019ll get us there \u2014 optimism kills. Infected with passion, our plans lose touch with reality. We overestimate strengths and underestimate challenges. Beyond the \"real data and real-world options,\" we build castles in the sky. That\u2019s one of the reasons platform like Woo, which lets you get feedback from companies and headhunters anonymously, are so valuable. \nWhere passion disconnects us from reality, planning \u2014 especially planning of the SMART goal and number-crunching variety \u2014 drives home the true state of affairs. \nThat true state rescues us from false expectations, show stoppers, and resentment. As a good friend of mine likes to say, \"The question when you\u2019re trying to bring a dream into reality shouldn\u2019t be, \u2018What going to go right?\u2019 It should be, \u2018What\u2019s going to go wrong?\u2019\" \nJason Stone, founder of Millionaire Mentor Inc.:\n\"Passion can only take you so far. After that, if you don't have the skills, the tools, the resources, the knowledge, and the track-record to move forward, take risks, and expand. Otherwise, you won\u2019t be able to position yourself as an authority. Positioning is key to make sure you are ready when opportunity strikes!\" \nHumans are associative creatures. We think and act not in isolation but by comparing and contrasting. \n\"The basic approach of positioning,\" wrote Al Ries and Jack Trout in Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind, \"is not to create something new and different, but to manipulate what\u2019s already up there in the mind, to retie the connections that already exist.\" This is especially true when it comes to how other people see us. \nPassionate people often come off as self-inflated. They\u2019re legends in their own minds. Positioning means leveraging who you are and what you\u2019ve done as a springboard to what\u2019s next. It embraces the associate nature of other people and \u2014 while it still leaves room for confidence \u2014 acknowledges that how others perceive us is more real, at least to them, than how we see ourselves. \nTroy Osinoff, author of My Bad Parent: Do As I Say, Not as I Did:\n\"People that think they completely understand their world are the most susceptible to overlook new opportunities. Peripheral is about establishing an unwavering curiosity to use your existing knowledge in uncovering new patterns and trends both for the sake of your personal development as well as the success of your business or career.\" \nPassion makes us myopic. We become so focused on the desire inside us, we lose sight of what\u2019s around us. Objectivity \u2014 the ability to see the world as it truly is \u2014 atrophies in the blinding light of passion. \nAdopting a peripheral perspective forces us to examine the margins. It widens our view. Rather than rush headlong into disaster, we\u2019re able to spot not just the pitfalls but the opportunities we would have otherwise missed. \nHow? By cultivating curiosity. Questions like, \"What am I missing? What am I ignoring? Who could give me a fresh take?\" are vital in every area of life. Likewise, so is putting ourselves in new situations, reading books outside our passions, and intentionally pursuing people who have nothing to do with what it is we think we want. \nBrian D. Evans, founder of Influencive and Inc. 500 Entrepreneur:\n\"The person who calls themselves a student is more a master than those who try to wear the title. Get up when you get knocked down. Come back stronger, faster, and (above all) smarter. The constant desire to learn and overcome has helped me achieve everything. You must persevere.\" \nAlthough it might sound odd, perseverance is as much about putting in effort as it is battling ego. Drunk on passion, masters are doomed to repeat failures in the name of \"pushing through.\" In contrast, students do more than hone their craft; they learn from their mistakes. \nAsked if the Patriot\u2019s historic comeback in Super Bowl LI was his \"greatest game ever,\" Tom Brady replied: \"[W]hen I think of an interception return for a touchdown, some other missed opportunities in the first 37, 38 minutes of the game, I don\u2019t really consider playing a good quarter-and-a-half, plus overtime as one of the \u2018best games ever\u2019 but it was certainly one of the most thrilling.\" \nCertainly Brandy persevered, and it\u2019d be nice if that guaranteed success. But sometimes you won\u2019t come back to win it. At least, not in the moment. Jobs will be lost. Pitches turned down. Relationships ended. And reviews harsh. \nFailure, however, isn\u2019t just an inevitable stepping stone toward success. Rejection is part of success itself. As Louis CK put it to a budding comedian, \"The only road to good shows is bad ones. Just go start having a bad time and, if you don\u2019t give up, you will get better.\" \nUnderstood rightly, no. But as the be-all-and-end-all? Yes. \nCal Newport\u2019s prescription was skill: passion is the result of excellence, not it\u2019s source. \nFar from a magic bullet, passion can mislead us, blind us, and even turn us in on ourselves. Newport was right: \"\u2018Follow your passion\u2019 might just be terrible advice.\" Thankfully, these seven habits put passion in its place so that the fire Jobs spoke of doesn\u2019t burn out ... but endures. \nAaron Orendorff is the founder of iconiContent and a regular contributor at Entrepreneur, Lifehacker, Fast Company, Business Insider and more.

That is, slightly more water than rice in the pot as the water fills in the nooks between the grains of rice.\n'Turn it on. Wait. Delicious rice! You can tweak a little bit if you like your rice fluffier or firmer.'\nSusan Shao also had some top tips for using a rice cooker - but many can apply to boiling rice using a pan as well.\n'When using a rice cooker, I follow these steps and the rice always comes out perfectly.\n'If you're not making sushi, wash the rice by rinsing it in cold water with your hand, making swirl motions three times. If you're making sushi rice, repeat this process 10 times instead of three.\n'When you add rice, the general rule of thumb is half a cup of rice per person.' She also advises adding just enough water to cover the rice. \nBut Jireh Tan offers an alternative for those who don't have a rice cooker, or don't want to invest in the equipment.\nSaying this technique has 'never' failed him, he advises washing the rice first, before measuring rice and water into a pot at a ratio of one cup of rice to 1.5 cups of water.\nHe adds: 'With pot uncovered, bring water to the boil, and boil for an additional two minutes.\n'Place the lid on the pot, reduce heat to lowest possible. Simmer for another eight minutes.\n'Take the pot off the heat. With the lid on, let the rice rest for another 15 minutes. \n'Remove the lid and fluff the rice, allowing any excess moisture to evaporate.' \nHe adds that the lid should not be removed when taken off the heat, as otherwise the bottom of the pan may end up black and burnt with rice sticking to it.",

        "targetParagraphs": "5/5 say yes.\nCheers to your health! All five of our experts give red wine a purple-stained smile.\nAt 125 calories for a five-ounce pour, it's a lighter choice than beer and mixed drinks, says Julia Zumpano , a dietitian at Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Heart & Vascular Institute. And yes, it's got more antioxidants, too\u2014including resveratrol, that famous compound billed as the miracle in chocolate and vino.\nBut recent research has given resveratrol the side eye as the reason for wine's healthy glow. The aptly-named inCHIANTI study, a 16-year-long look at the blood, urine and dietary questionnaires of hundreds of people living in the Italian wine-making region of Chianti, recently found that resveratrol wasn't associated with disease or lifespan, to the shock and dismay of wine lovers everywhere. But that doesn't mean red wine does nothing for you\u2014just that resveratrol might not be compound that deserves all the credit. \"Many studies have shown that moderate alcohol consumption, especially wine, is associated with lower cardiovascular disease and mortality compared with both no alcohol consumption or consumption above moderate,\" says Luigi Ferrucci , founder of the inCHIANTI study and now scientific director of the National Institute on Aging. \"The mechanism of this association is not clear, and does not appear to be related to resveratrol.\"\nAnd even if it does have a positive effect, some experts say there's likely not enough in a glass to make a difference. \"Despite the common belief, resveratrol content in wine is very low, highly variable and thus unpredictable ,\" says Juan Carlos Espi\u0301n , a research professor in the department of food science and technology at the Spanish National Research Council who studies the compound. Red wine's wide spectrum of polyphenols is the more important part, and you'll probably have to commit to the habit (moderately!) to get lasting health benefits, he says.\nWhat we do know, says David Katz , MD, director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center, is that drinking habitually but moderately prevails in the Mediterranean diet. \"So whatever the mechanisms, moderate alcohol intake\u2014perhaps red wine especially\u2014is associated with health and long life,\" Katz says.\nLight drinking in general\u2014up to a drink a day for women, and two for men\u2014is known to be good for you, says James O'Keefe, MD, chief of preventive cardiology at Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City. It\u2019s associated with lower risk for coronary artery disease, diabetes, congestive heart failure and stroke. And all of our experts agreed that red wine takes the ribbon. \"Red wine is clearly the drink of choice if you are doing light to moderate drinking for your health, and daily consumption just before or with the evening meal may be the most protective pattern,\" O\u2019Keefe says.\nIn fact, O\u2019Keefe says his grandma Dorothy used to enjoy a happy hour drink every night, and she lived to be 103. \"She used to joke, \u2018The key to a long healthy life is to not drink too much...but then again, don't drink too little either.\u2019\"",

        "targetParagraphs": "Plenty has been made of the big Congressional Budget Office finding that 24 million people could lose their insurance under Republicans' Obamacare replacement over the next decade. That's higher than expected and poses a clear and massive hurdle for Republicans as they attempt to convince dozens of skeptical members.\nBut there's another number that paints a particularly dire picture for the GOP's alternative \u2014 especially in light of President Trump's populist rhetoric.\nAccording to the CBO, 64-year olds making $26,500 per year would see their premiums increase by an estimated 750 percent by 2026. While they are on track to pay $1,700 under the current law, the CBO projects the American Health Care Act would force them to pay $14,600. Even if you grant that inflation will allow them to make slightly more money by 2026, that's still about half of their income going to health care.\nHere's how that looks as a percentage of income (h/t Philip Bump):\nAs skeptics of the law noted, that suggests the reason premiums as a whole will eventually decline is because older, poorer people simply won't be able to afford it. The legislation reduces premiums substantially for younger people but increases them substantially for older people \u2014 and especially poorer, older people \u2014 according to the CBO.\nThe CBO's estimate of the premium increases for older, poorer Americans is actually worse than a previous one from AARP. Here's what AARP, which has announced its opposition to the bill, said last week:\n... Our estimates find that, taken together, premiums for older adults could increase by as much as $3,600 for a 55-year old earning $25,000 a year, $7,000 for a 64-year old earning $25,000 a year and up to $8,400 for a 64-year old earning $15,000 a year.\nIf you're a Republican looking at these numbers, you have to be concerned \u2014 just from a self-preservation standpoint.\nRepublican leaders have made great pains to argue that the CBO's estimate of the millions who will lose insurance is faulty, or even that it's a necessary side effect of returning to a more free-market approach to health care. But the GOP's counter-argument is predicated on the idea that its alternative would at least allow people access to coverage. Paying such a substantial portion of one's income on health insurance doesn't meet that goal \u2014 if, in fact, the CBO's estimate is anywhere close to accurate.\nIt also affects a group of voters who are integral to the Trump Coalition. Less-formally educated and lower-income white Americans were the backbone of the electoral shift that allowed President Trump to be elected, and he has promised them the world: Coverage that is even more affordable than the Affordable Care Act and \"insurance for everybody.\"\nOn top of all that, older people are much more likely to vote than younger people, especially in a midterm election like 2018. So basically, Trump's win was built on older, poorer people, for whom this law appears to drive up premiums and drive down the insurance rate, while benefiting the younger and wealthier.\nThat's not something that will assure skeptical Republicans at all \u2014 even if they can get past that 24 million number.",

        "targetParagraphs": "Almost every place you shop online has a \"promotional code\" box at checkout -- but fewer than a quarter of shoppers use it. We asked the experts for their best advice on where and how to cash in.\nBy Lynn Andriani\nStart With Your Wardrobe\nDavid Weinrot, chief marketing officer at the coupon code site Tada!, says apparel is the top category for sitewide coupon codes (flowers and home goods are big, too), since there's so much inventory and retailers constantly need to make room for new items. Clothing is also where you'll find the biggest discounts, says Daniel Washburn, general manager of another coupon-code site, Coupon Mountain. While some sites broadcast a \"25% off today only!\" coupon code at the top of their home page, more use coupon sites (which get a commission of about 5 percent when you click on a code) to get the word out. There are a couple of tricks to finding these money-saving treasures, aside from searching for a store name with a term like \"coupon\" or \"coupon code,\" says Sarah Jones, coupon editor at DealNews.com. For clothing, she searches the brand name and style name (e.g., \"Michael Kors Chain Lace-Up Shirtdress\") plus the word \"coupon.\" Then she searches for coupons for stores that sell the item, to see what they are currently offering. The idea is to do a mix of general and specific searches to see what comes up.\nUpgrade Your Electronics Piece by Piece\nTech retailers, such as TigerDirect and Newegg, release the most coupon codes, says Jones -- but you won't find 30 percent off everything sitewide with those retailers. Since the category has such small margins, stores can't afford to discount widely; instead, they offer codes that give heavy discounts for particular items. For the quickest results, Jones likes to search by model number (this works especially well for electronics and computers).\nShop At The Beginning Of The Month -- Or On A Monday\nMost retailers release their codes onto sales channels at the beginning of the month, and the majority expire on the 15th or 30th. In particular, Weinrot says retailers that sell items that need replenishing -- such as vitamins, diapers and contact-lens solutions -- tend to release coupon codes early in the month, since they know that's when people tend to restock. You can look for codes throughout the month on Mondays, since many stores rotate new offers on a weekly basis, says Jones.\nDo The Math\nPrices vary widely: You might find that one store's price without a coupon might be better than another store's price with one. Also consider shipping costs. For instance, a store that has everyday free shipping may have a price that comes out lower with a 10-percent-off coupon than another store's 20-percent coupon with shipping charges added, says Jones. A general rule of thumb: For smaller purchases, take a free shipping code over a code for 10 percent off; for larger purchases, 10 percent (or more) off will probably save you more money than free shipping would.\nKnow Who Discounts\nSome stores rarely or never offer coupon codes (Jones cites Walmart and Zappos as examples). But DealNews shared with us their list of the top 25 retailers, sorted by volume of published coupons in 2013:\n1. Newegg\n2. TigerDirect\n3. Groupon\n4. LivingSocial\n5. Sharkstores\n6. 6pm.com\n7. Ashford\n8. Lenovo\n9. Target\n10. Sears\n11. Macy's\n12. Snapfish\n13. Bath & Body Works\n14. Discount Watch Store\n15. Kmart\n16. RazorGator\n17. Plum District\n18. Geeks.com\n19. HSN\n20.

        "targetParagraphs": "The subway is a germaphobe\u2019s nightmare: the steep stairs that dare you not to hold the handrail, the ticket-vending touchscreen tacky with fingerprints, the smush of people packed together, all with questionable levels of hygiene.\nThis must mean that subway cars are just as packed with microbes . But should we be worried? A group of researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health wanted to find out, so they took a bunch of trips on the Boston city subway and started swabbing. In their new study published in the American Society for Microbiology\u2019s journal mSystems , the scientists report on what they found when they sampled the seats, seat backs, walls, poles, ticketing machines and hanging straps on the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority.\nThey were amazed at how much the city subway looks, microbially speaking, like a mosaic of humans. The most dominant bacteria on all of the surfaces were from people's skin and mouths. And the kinds of colonies that thrived in certain places, like hanging grips, depended on how that surface is used: the scientists found enriched colonies of breathing-borne bacteria on touchscreens and vaginal bacteria on fuzzy polyester seats. Happily, though, the scientists didn\u2019t find pathogenic organisms that typically cause sickness or antibiotic-resistant genes.\n\"I was surprised by the degree to which these environments really do look like people,\" says senior author Curtis Huttenhower, associate professor of computational biology and bioinformatics. \"But if you think about the relative size of a bacteria compared to how porous clothing is, it\u2019s no surprise that we\u2019re shedding all sorts of bugs.\"\nIn the future, this kind of technology might be helpful to monitor the microbes in different environments, like a subway, an airport or a kindergarten classroom. If the colonies started to shift from their normal state, that could signal the start of flu season or an early outbreak of norovirus, for example, and officials would get an early cue that it\u2019s time to step up interventions like handwashing.\nSo ditch the tissue when you hold the train pole. Riding the subway, Huttenhower says, is just like shaking a bunch of people\u2019s hands.",

        "targetParagraphs": "Ever wonder why there are only like, 12 Gryffindors in Harry's year?\nEver wondered how many students are at Hogwarts? J.K. Rowling's response in an interview back in 2000 gave the answer: about 1,000. \nBut when you look closer, that number doesn't make a lot of sense. Why are there so few students in Harry's class?\nThis screencap shows Percy Weasley taking the first-year Gryffindors to their common room. In this scene, there are only about 18 students. Even in the books, Gryffindors in Harry's year besides Dean, Seamus, and the other usual suspects are rarely mentioned.\nThat's almost half as many students as there should be, if Hogwarts has 1,000 students as Rowling said.\nThere are seven years, and four houses. So theoretically, there should be about 35 Gryffindor students in Harry's year, almost double the 18 we see.\nSo, why the lack of students? This Tumblr user has a very sad answer:\nTLDR: There are fewer kids in Harry's year and thereabouts because of the war with Voldemort.\nWhich is a pretty sad thought.\nIf that was the case, we should expect a bit of a baby boom in the years under Harry, as that tends to happen following major wars.\nVoldemort's reign occurred from about 1970 to 1981, so we would expect small classes in the years above Harry as well, but larger ones in the years below.\nOf course, none of this explains the sheer numbers of the Weasley family.",

        "targetParagraphs": "By Mark Alsip and Kavin Senapathy\nDepending on whom you ask, Goop.com is either a ritzy lifestyle publication or a grab bag of the ridiculous, from advice on vaginal steam treatments to a shopping section featuring a $73 wooden spoon and a $576 earring (you read that right; it\u2019s a single earring for the left ear).\nThe site\u2019s curator, actress and aspirational human being Gwyneth Paltrow, isn\u2019t only out to sell a lifestyle but to protect us from the so-called toxins she claims lurk in beauty products, foods and non-steamed vaginas found in average neighborhoods, poisoning unsuspecting commoners. The site\u2019s name is derived from Paltrow\u2019s initials and features her face throughout, at times smiling, other times solemn, and occasionally covered in high-end luxury goop, known as face cream or mask for the frugal department store shoppers. In other words, Goop is an internet extension of all things Gwyneth.\nAs Paltrow herself has been called a hypocrite, for everything from smoking cigarettes once a week to attending a swanky gala mere hours after publicly shopping on a food stamp budget, so too should Goop be judged. When celebs and sites whose advice fans hold dear warn against exposure to certain ostensibly harmful chemicals and in the next breath sell products containing those same substances, we wonder whether they\u2019re disingenuous or sincerely misinformed. This chemical hypocrisy is a common phenomenon as co-author Mark Alsip frequently reveals on his Bad Science Debunked blog, and one Goop is no stranger to.\nIn the Goop article \"Full-On\u2014Yet Totally Non-Toxic\u2014Lipstick,\" the site recommends seven \"better-than-good-enough-to-eat\" lip colors that aren\u2019t \"potentially toxic.\" This and other Goop articles suggest dire health consequences from topical use or ingestion of several chemicals including aluminum, and personal care products containing it are squarely in the lifestyle maven\u2019s crosshairs. An entire Goop expose\u0301 dedicated to \"toxic\" lipsticks features aluminum, the most common metal in the Earth\u2019s crust, prominently as an ingredient to avoid.\nSince Goop asserts that aluminum is harmful even in small amounts, we wonder whether Paltrow\u2019s team intentionally overlooked that two of the three Rituel de Fille \"Forbidden\" lipsticks the site sells contain aluminum hydroxide. Paltrow\u2019s unscientific definition of a \"dangerous\" chemical compound seems to be the mere presence of aluminum rather than the amount and mode of exposure, an important distinction toxicologists make. Nearly a dozen products on Goop contain the element in various compounds, and peddling the item on the same website that calls it dangerous is indefensible.\nAluminum, Paltrow\u2019s site warns, can contribute to heavy metal toxicity, calling the condition \"one of the greatest threats to our health and well-being.\" Perhaps Goop needs to add a disclaimer: Expect hyperbole. Though Goop says that heavy metal toxicity is \"quite common,\" experts disagree. \"Unfortunately for quacks (and fortunately for us), genuine heavy metal poisoning is increasingly uncommon,\" explains Dr. David Gorski, outspoken critic of alternative medicine, at the Science Based Medicine blog. \"[O]ften the diagnosis of \"heavy metal toxicity\" made by alt-med practitioners is based on 'provoked' urine levels, a methodology that has no validity.\"",

It started with two sets of three parallel lines that were joined diagonally left to right, then capped off at the top and bottom with pointy bits. It was a fierce, beautiful \"S,\" and drawing it was addictive.\nSoon all my schoolbooks were covered in the \"S.\" I never questioned what it meant or where it came from. I just knew I loved it. But it turns out I wasn't the only one.\nI recently googled the \"S\" and discovered that although everyone loves it, no one knows its origins. Various Reddits and notice boards are full of really nostalgic people without a clue.\nIt seems the \"S\" has appeared throughout all of North America, South America, Europe, Russia, Asia, and Australia. Some people think it's a 90s thing; others report seeing it as early as the 1960s. There were theories that it was the symbol of some 80s hair-metal band. Other people thought it was the original emblem for the clothing brand Stussy. Others thought it was an incarnation of the Superman logo. No one was sure.\nI thought I'd ask the office.\n\"That's the Superman 'S,'\" mused Ben, our in-house graphics guy. I asked him if that meant it was actually from Superman, but he said it wasn't. \"No, I think it's just what kids think when they're drawing it. They really just draw it because it's cool.\"\nI got on the phone to DC Comics to find out if they knew anything. According to Benjamin LeClear, who manages the comics library at their studio in Burbank, California, the \"S\" has nothing to do with Superman.\n\"It doesn't look like any of the emblems from the old Superman Shield logos,\" he said after rummaging through their collection. \"His 'S' has a lot of open space and almost never connects to itself.\"\nLeClear told me he'd become intrigued and, like me, launched his own mini investigation on the web only to turn up nothing. \"I didn't realize what a crazy urban myth and mystery this pointy 'S' thing is,\" he said. \"I would love for this to be Superman-related, but I don't think it is. Though Superman has the most famous 'S' symbol of all time.\"\n\"It's the Stussy 'S,'\" exclaimed Ramona, one of our producers. Like Ben's guess, she didn't think it was actually an emblem associated with Stussy, but refused to believe it had any other name. \"It's definitely called the Stussy 'S,'\" she said, then drew her own version that wasn't as good as mine.\nPretty much every forum on the web mentions Stussy\u2014the Californian surf/street-wear company founded in the 80s. A lot of people seem convinced the symbol was originally a Stussy logo, so I called Stussy.\n\"No, this is not an original Stussy Logo,\" stated Emmy Coates, who has worked alongside Shawn Stussy since 1985. \"I personally get asked this a lot, but people have been drawing this 'S' long before Stussy was established. People have just assumed it was Stussy, and it's sort of spread from there. It's actually quite amusing.\"\nI finally asked Coates what she thought the symbol looked like. \"It looks like Suzuki logo,\" she replied.\nI was tempted to call Suzuki but didn't. I needed to zoom out and take in the bigger picture, so I got in touch with an expert in symbols and semiotics: Paul Cobley.\nCobley is a professor in language and media at Middlesex University in London. According to him, the theory that it was a hair-metal symbol was also ridiculous\u2014\"It's certainly not the Saxon logo,\" he said. \"Theirs was far more sharp and had a staff.\" Then he offered the most likely yet bland explanation of all. That is, it's fun to draw.\n\"The reason kids go through this is probably because it's a Moebius strip ,\" he said, referring to the sort of looped one-surface shapes M. C. Escher was fond of drawing. \"It can't be drawn continuously, but it does have a perpetual flow.\"\nMoebius strip. I think he was onto something. Most nine-year-olds can't draw, so when someone hands them a magical recipe to create something fairly cool on demand, that'll go viral. Especially when the shape has the sophisticated, mathematical lineage of a Moebius strip. Yes I'd learned the term ten minutes earlier, but whatever.\nThe \"S\" isn't a Stussy logo or a Superman emblem or a gift from aliens. I think it's just the most fun ever.",

        "targetParagraphs": "Why Jeff Goldblum Plans To Sneak Into A Movie Theater Showing Independence Day 2 By Sean O'Connell Roland Emmerich makes movies that demand to be seen on the big screen. Not just a big screen. The biggest screen possible. From the monumental explosions of Independence Day (pun intended) to the planet-rattling chaos of 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow, Emmerich specializes in sequences that fill every inch of the screen with practical and digital madness. Which is exactly why Jeff Goldblum plans to see his latest collaboration with Emmerich -- Independence Day: Resurgence -- in a theater, with a paying crowd, to appreciate how they react to the insanity. Late last year, I was lucky enough to travel to New Mexico and watch Emmerich at work on the set of Independence Day: Resurgence. It looked like a massive undertaking, and I peppered the cast with questions about the process of working on such an epic blockbuster. Jeff Goldblum, over the course of one of his answers, talked about the joy of seeing one of Emmerich's movies with a crowd, and told me the following reason why he plans to sneak in while the movie's playing and enjoy it with a public audience: You've asked the right person... because I do like to watch movies. ... I'm thinking of several scenes. It's a spectacular... once again, you can imagine, there's much spectacle. I will tell you this. There's more spectacle than I have seen in any... I think it moves the ball, it raises the bar, whatever metaphor I'm stupidly trying to think of, ahead. So it's going to be something that, even though you think you have seen everything before, you'll go, 'I never... That's bigger, and more than I thought!' So some of that. And I'll enjoy that. And like the last one, it's got some heart, I believe. Roland Emmerich is a person of soulful wisdom and humanity. Once again, he's very interested and passionate about creating characters that, for him, tell a story of loveliness and love, of comradeship and some very touching and sweet and funny things. He's got a very keen sense of humor. So I'm hoping that those moments will be delightful in those ways. And I can imagine, you know, watching it with the audience! If you can believe it, during that last bit of his answer, Jeff Goldblum actually pantomimed himself eating popcorn, surrounded by an audience as they enjoyed Independence Day: Resurgence together. This is only part of his incredible explanation of the joy of working with Roland Emmerich, so you really have to watch the above clip to get the Full Goldblum, as I now like to call it. Roland Emmerich's Independence Day: Resurgence takes place 20 years after the original film. Humanity is using alien tech acquired from our original encounter with the intergalactic species to bolster our planet's defense systems. Only, the aliens are back... and they are better prepared. Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Vivica A. Fox, Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner reprise their original roles in the sequel, joining newcomers Liam Hemsworth, Maika Monroe, Joey King, Sela Ward, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Jessie T. Usher. The movie will be in theaters on June 24. And if you go on opening weekend, look around. You might be sitting next to a wide-eyed Jeff Goldblum. Tell him we said hello.

Jacobsen, Ph.D., a professor of epidemiology and global health at George Mason University. If that bacteria seeps into your skin, you're at risk for an infection.\nIt sounds scary\u2014and it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry\u2014but keeping your feet covered is mostly precautionary.\nJacobsen says that for most of us, the risk of contracting an infection from going sock-less at security is pretty low. In part, that\u2019s because security lines are well-ventilated and have dry floors, so you\u2019re unlikely to pick up either foot fungi (think: athlete\u2019s foot) or plantar warts\u2014both of which tend to come from damp environments, like locker rooms with showers.\nThere are exceptions. Anyone with a weakened immune system (for example, if you suffer from diabetes-related foot problems) or with cuts on their feet could more easily have pathogens enter the body, Jacobsen says.",

His latest move involves sinking some cash into Qloo , a startup that bills itself as a \"cultural recommendations engine.\"\nSo how does it work? Qloo says it has \"mapped the taste genome\" by combing through massive amounts of data. Then, it spits out answers to burning questions from brands and advertisers about the preferences of their target audiences when it comes to things like food, music and TV. For instance, as TechCrunch reports , Qloo can tell you the favorite music artists of fans of the Golden State Warriors vs. fans of the Cleveland Cavaliers. That's no small thing: it helps advertisers ensure they're marketing the right things to both groups, collectively or separately, based on what they do and don't share. (For instance, Warriors fans like Drake and Cavs fans like Li'l Wayne, but both groups like pizza and SportsCenter.)\nThe Series A round, which DiCaprio participated in, raised $4.5 million for the company.

        "targetParagraphs": "Voter-ID laws are part of a hoary American tradition holding that people who aren't economically independent can't make reasoned political choices.\nIf Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protesters succeed in booting C.Y. Leung from power, the city\u2019s unelected chief executive should consider coming to the United States. He might fit in well in the Republican Party.\nIn an interview Monday with The New York Times and other foreign newspapers, Leung explained that Beijing cannot permit the direct election of Hong Kong\u2019s leaders because doing so would empower \"the people in Hong Kong who earn less than $1,800 a month.\" Leung instead defended the current plan to have a committee of roughly 1,200 eminent citizens vet potential contenders because doing so, in the Times\u2019 words, \"would insulate candidates from popular pressure to create a welfare state, and would allow the city government to follow more business-friendly policies.\"\nIf that sounds vaguely familiar, it should. Leung\u2019s views about the proper relationship between democracy and economic policy represent a more extreme version of the views supported by many in today\u2019s GOP.\nStart with Mitt Romney. In 2012, at a fundraiser with ultra-wealthy donors, the Republican nominee famously denigrated the \"47 percent\" of Americans who \"believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing\"\u2014to a welfare state. Because these self-appointed \"victims\" were voting in order to get things from government, Romney argued, their motives were inferior to the potential Romney voters who \"take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\"\nIn distinguishing between Americans whose economic independence permits them to make reasoned political choices and those who because of their poverty cannot, Romney was channeling a hoary American tradition. In 1776, John Adams argued that men (let alone women) \"who are wholly destitute of Property\" were \"too dependent upon other Men to have a Will of their own.\" In 1800, only three states allowed property-less white men to vote. For most of the 20th century, southern states imposed \"poll taxes\" that effectively barred not only African Americans from voting but some poor whites as well.\nRomney didn\u2019t suggest that the 47 percent be denied the right to vote, of course. But other Republicans have flirted with the idea. In 2010, Tea Party Nation President Judson Phillips observed that \"The Founding Fathers ... put certain restrictions on who gets the right to vote ... one of those was you had to be a property owner. And that makes a lot of sense, because if you\u2019re a property owner you actually have a vested stake in the community.\" In 2011, Iowa Representative Steve King made a similar observation, noting approvingly, \"There was a time in American history when you had to be a male property owner in order to vote. The reason for that was, because [the Founding Fathers] wanted the people who voted\u2014that set the public policy, that decided on the taxes and the spending\u2014to have some skin in the game. Now we have data out there that shows that 47 percent of American households don\u2019t pay taxes ... But many of them are voting. And when they vote, they vote for more government benefits.\" In 2012, Florida House candidate Ted Yoho remarked, \"I\u2019ve had some radical ideas about voting and it\u2019s probably not a good time to tell them, but you used to have to be a property owner to vote.\" Yoho went on to win the election.\nPhilips, King, and Yoho are outliers. Most prominent Republicans would never propose that poor people be denied the franchise. But they support policies that do just that. When GOP legislatures make it harder to vote\u2014either by restricting early voting, limiting the hours that polls remain open, requiring voter identification or disenfranchising ex-felons\u2014the press usually focuses on the disproportionate impact on racial minorities and Democrats. But the most profound impact may be on the poor.\nVoter-identification laws, in particular, act as new form of poll tax. After Texas passed its voter-ID law, a study found that Texans who earned less than $20,000 per year were more than 10 times more likely to lack the necessary identification than Texans who earned more than $150,000. On the surface, this discrepancy might seem possible to remedy, since courts have generally demanded that the states that require voter identification provide some form of ID for free. But there\u2019s a catch. Acquiring that free ID requires showing another form of identification\u2014and those cost money. In the states with voter-ID laws, notes a report by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law School, \"Birth certificates can cost between $8 and $25. Marriage licenses, required for married women whose birth certificates include a maiden name, can cost between $8 and $20. By comparison, the notorious poll tax\u2014outlawed during the civil rights era\u2014cost $10.64 in current dollars.\"\nTo make matters worse, roughly half a million people without access to a car live more than 10 miles from the nearest office that regularly issues IDs. And the states that require IDs, which just happen to be mostly in the south, also just happen to have some of the worst public transportation in the country.\nNot surprisingly, a 2007 study by researchers at Washington University and Cal Tech found that, \"registered voters with low levels of educational attainment or lower levels of income are less likely to vote the more restrictive the voter identification regime.\" Barring former felons from voting has an even more dramatic impact on the poor, since almost half of state prison inmates earned less than $10,000 in the year before their incarceration.\nObviously, the United States is not Hong Kong. But there\u2019s a reason some of the city\u2019s demonstrators have adopted the label \"Occupy.\" Like the Americans who assembled in Zuccotti Park in 2011, they are fighting a system in which political exclusion and economic exclusion reinforce each other. Hong Kong\u2019s chief oligarch is named C.Y. Leung. But here in the U.S., we have ours too.",

        "targetParagraphs": "As co-founder of Hotwire.com and CEO of Zillow for the last seven years, 39-year-old Spencer Rascoff fits most people's definition of success. As a father of three young children, Spencer is a busy guy at home and at work.\nWhat's the one thing that Spencer refuses to do on the weekend? Work at least, in the traditional sense.\nJacquelyn Smith shared some interesting insights from Spencer in her article on how successful people spend their weekends:\nI never go into the office on weekends, Spencer says, but I do check e-mail at night. My weekends are an important time to unplug from the day-to-day and get a chance to think more deeply about my company and my industry. Weekends are a great chance to reflect and be more introspective about bigger issues.\nA new study from Stanford shows that Rascoff is on to something.\nThe study found that productivity per hour declines sharply when the workweek exceeds 50 hours, and it drops off so much after 55 hours that there's no point in working any more. That's right, people who work as much as 70 hours (or more) per week actually get the same amount done as people who work 55 hours. Those extra hours are wasted.\nSuccessful people know the importance of shifting gears on the weekend to relaxing and rejuvenating activities. Like Spencer, they use their weekends to create a better week ahead.\nThis is easier said than done, so here's some help. The following list contains 10 things that successful people do to find balance on the weekend and to come into work at 110% on Monday morning.\n1. They Wake Up at the Same Time\nIt's tempting to sleep in on the weekend to catch up on your sleep. Though it feels good temporarily, having an inconsistent wake-up time disturbs your circadian rhythm. Your body cycles through an elaborate series of sleep phases in order for you to wake up rested and refreshed. One of these phases involves preparing your mind to be awake and alert, which is why people often wake up just before their alarm clock goes off (the brain is trained and ready). When you sleep past your regular wake-up time on the weekend, you end up feeling groggy and tired. This isn't just disruptive to your day off, it also makes you less productive on Monday because your brain isn't ready to wake up at your regular time. If you need to catch up on sleep, just go to bed earlier.\n2. They Designate Mornings as Me Time\nIt can be difficult to get time to yourself on the weekends, especially if you have family. Finding a way to engage in an activity you're passionate about first thing in the morning can pay massive dividends in happiness and cleanliness of mind. It's also a great way to perfect your circadian rhythm by forcing yourself to wake up at the same time you do on weekdays. Your mind achieves peak performance two-to-four hours after you wake up, so get up early to do something physical, and then sit down and engage in something mental while your mind is at its peak.\n3. They Schedule Micro-Adventures\nBuy tickets to a concert or play, or get reservations for that cool new hotel that just opened downtown. Instead of running on a treadmill, plan a hike. Try something you haven't done before or perhaps something you haven't done in a long time. Studies show that anticipating something good to come is a significant part of what makes the activity pleasurable. Knowing that you have something interesting planned for Saturday will not only be fun come Saturday, but it will significantly improve your mood throughout the week.\n4. They Pursue a Passion\nYou might be surprised what happens when you pursue something you're passionate about on weekends. Indulging your passions is a great way to escape stress and to open your mind to new ways of thinking. Things like playing music, reading, writing, painting, or even playing catch with your kids can help stimulate different modes of thought that can reap huge dividends over the coming week.\n5. They Disconnect\nDisconnecting is the most important weekend strategy on this list, because if you can't find a way to remove yourself electronically from your work Friday evening through Monday morning, then you've never really left work.\nMaking yourself available to your work 24/7 exposes you to a constant barrage of stressors that prevent you from refocusing and recharging. If taking the entire weekend off handling work e-mails and calls isn't realistic, try designating specific times on Saturday and Sunday for checking e-mails and responding to voicemails. For example, check your messages on Saturday afternoon while your kids are getting a haircut and on Sunday evenings after dinner. Scheduling short blocks of time will alleviate stress without sacrificing availability.\n6. They Minimize Chores\nChores have a funny habit of completely taking over your weekends. When this happens, you lose the opportunity to relax and reflect. What's worse is that a lot of chores feel like work, and if you spend all weekend doing them, you just put in a seven-day workweek. To keep this from happening, you need to schedule your chores like you would anything else during the week, and if you don't complete them during the allotted time, you move on and finish them the following weekend.\n7. They Exercise\nNo time to exercise during the week? You have 48 hours every weekend to make it happen. Getting your body moving for as little as 10 minutes releases GABA, a soothing neurotransmitter that reduces stress. Exercise is also a great way to come up with new ideas. Innovators and other successful people know that being outdoors often sparks creativity.\nI know that a lot of my best ideas come to me while I'm surfing. While you're out in the ocean, the combination of invigorating activity and beautiful scenery creates the perfect environment for an influx of creativity. Whether you're running, cycling, or gardening, exercise leads to endorphin-fueled introspection. The key is to find a physical activity that does this for you and then to make it an important part of your weekend routine.\n8. They Reflect\nWeekly reflection is a powerful tool for improvement. Use the weekend to contemplate the larger forces that are shaping your industry, your organization, and your job. Without the distractions of Monday to Friday busy work, you should be able to see things in a whole new light. Use this insight to alter your approach to the coming week, improving the efficiency and efficacy of your work.\n9. They Spend Quality Time with Family\nSpending quality time with your family on the weekend is essential if you want to recharge and relax. Family time on the weekend is so important to Spencer Rascoff that he flies home for the weekend, no matter how far away he is, even if he has to be in the same city the following week. Weekdays are so hectic that the entire week can fly by with little quality family time. Don't let this bleed into your weekends. Take your kids to the park, take your spouse to his or her favorite restaurant, and go visit your parents. You'll be glad you did.\n10. They Prepare for the Upcoming Week\nThe weekend is a great time to spend a few moments planning your upcoming week. As little as 30 minutes of planning can yield significant gains in productivity and reduced stress. The week feels a lot more manageable when you go into it with a plan because all you have to do is execute it.",

        "targetParagraphs": "Fun fact: Leonardo DiCaprio, everyone's favorite Oscar winner and climate change activist, is also a low-key businessman. The actor has invested in everything from a garbage company to an Amazonian tea purveyor and the popular mattress startup Casper, as documented on Crunchbase . His latest move involves sinking some cash into Qloo , a startup that bills itself as a \"cultural recommendations engine.\"\nSo how does it work? Qloo says it has \"mapped the taste genome\" by combing through massive amounts of data. Then, it spits out answers to burning questions from brands and advertisers about the preferences of their target audiences when it comes to things like food, music and TV. For instance, as TechCrunch reports , Qloo can tell you the favorite music artists of fans of the Golden State Warriors vs. fans of the Cleveland Cavaliers. That's no small thing: it helps advertisers ensure they're marketing the right things to both groups, collectively or separately, based on what they do and don't share. (For instance, Warriors fans like Drake and Cavs fans like Li'l Wayne, but both groups like pizza and SportsCenter.)\nThe Series A round, which DiCaprio participated in, raised $4.5 million for the company. DiCaprio certainly has eclectic taste in investments; only time will tell if this endeavor will reap the same kinds of rewards he's been bringing in with his work on the big screen.",

Now is your time to stock up on these soon-to-be souvenirs. WDW News reported the changes today, noting that they've been around since 1987. As a fan, you probably already know that Disney Dollars don't expire, so if you have some laying around, don't panic. They'll still be accepted as they are now at Disney parks and stores, they just won't be producing or selling any additional bills after Saturday. Because of the popularity of gift cards and digital money, Disney thought it best to discontinue the currency. #NeverForget.\nIt's the end of an era, friends! As technology advances, it seems we're constantly moving away from the good old days. Lately, it seems as though we're always saying goodbye to reminders of our childhood. Sob! This time, it's Disney who's going all bittersweet on us. If you're a true Disneyland or Disney World fan, you'll understand the importance of Disney Dollars. Park goers and even Disney Store shoppers can use the cash like real money. The bills are decorated with familiar characters and monuments and are light years cuter than regular money.\nThis content is available customized for our international audience.

        "postText": "Should the poor be allowed to vote?",
        "targetParagraphs": "Voter-ID laws are part of a hoary American tradition holding that people who aren't economically independent can't make reasoned political choices.\nIf Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protesters succeed in booting C.Y. Leung from power, the city\u2019s unelected chief executive should consider coming to the United States. He might fit in well in the Republican Party.\nIn an interview Monday with The New York Times and other foreign newspapers, Leung explained that Beijing cannot permit the direct election of Hong Kong\u2019s leaders because doing so would empower \"the people in Hong Kong who earn less than $1,800 a month.\" Leung instead defended the current plan to have a committee of roughly 1,200 eminent citizens vet potential contenders because doing so, in the Times\u2019 words, \"would insulate candidates from popular pressure to create a welfare state, and would allow the city government to follow more business-friendly policies.\"\nIf that sounds vaguely familiar, it should. Leung\u2019s views about the proper relationship between democracy and economic policy represent a more extreme version of the views supported by many in today\u2019s GOP.\nStart with Mitt Romney. In 2012, at a fundraiser with ultra-wealthy donors, the Republican nominee famously denigrated the \"47 percent\" of Americans who \"believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing\"\u2014to a welfare state. Because these self-appointed \"victims\" were voting in order to get things from government, Romney argued, their motives were inferior to the potential Romney voters who \"take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\"\nIn distinguishing between Americans whose economic independence permits them to make reasoned political choices and those who because of their poverty cannot, Romney was channeling a hoary American tradition. In 1776, John Adams argued that men (let alone women) \"who are wholly destitute of Property\" were \"too dependent upon other Men to have a Will of their own.\" In 1800, only three states allowed property-less white men to vote. For most of the 20th century, southern states imposed \"poll taxes\" that effectively barred not only African Americans from voting but some poor whites as well.\nRomney didn\u2019t suggest that the 47 percent be denied the right to vote, of course. But other Republicans have flirted with the idea. In 2010, Tea Party Nation President Judson Phillips observed that \"The Founding Fathers ... put certain restrictions on who gets the right to vote ... one of those was you had to be a property owner. And that makes a lot of sense, because if you\u2019re a property owner you actually have a vested stake in the community.\" In 2011, Iowa Representative Steve King made a similar observation, noting approvingly, \"There was a time in American history when you had to be a male property owner in order to vote. The reason for that was, because [the Founding Fathers] wanted the people who voted\u2014that set the public policy, that decided on the taxes and the spending\u2014to have some skin in the game. Now we have data out there that shows that 47 percent of American households don\u2019t pay taxes ... But many of them are voting. And when they vote, they vote for more government benefits.\" In 2012, Florida House candidate Ted Yoho remarked, \"I\u2019ve had some radical ideas about voting and it\u2019s probably not a good time to tell them, but you used to have to be a property owner to vote.\" Yoho went on to win the election.\nPhilips, King, and Yoho are outliers. Most prominent Republicans would never propose that poor people be denied the franchise. But they support policies that do just that. When GOP legislatures make it harder to vote\u2014either by restricting early voting, limiting the hours that polls remain open, requiring voter identification or disenfranchising ex-felons\u2014the press usually focuses on the disproportionate impact on racial minorities and Democrats. But the most profound impact may be on the poor.\nVoter-identification laws, in particular, act as new form of poll tax. After Texas passed its voter-ID law, a study found that Texans who earned less than $20,000 per year were more than 10 times more likely to lack the necessary identification than Texans who earned more than $150,000. On the surface, this discrepancy might seem possible to remedy, since courts have generally demanded that the states that require voter identification provide some form of ID for free. But there\u2019s a catch. Acquiring that free ID requires showing another form of identification\u2014and those cost money. In the states with voter-ID laws, notes a report by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law School, \"Birth certificates can cost between $8 and $25. Marriage licenses, required for married women whose birth certificates include a maiden name, can cost between $8 and $20. By comparison, the notorious poll tax\u2014outlawed during the civil rights era\u2014cost $10.64 in current dollars.\"\nTo make matters worse, roughly half a million people without access to a car live more than 10 miles from the nearest office that regularly issues IDs. And the states that require IDs, which just happen to be mostly in the south, also just happen to have some of the worst public transportation in the country.\nNot surprisingly, a 2007 study by researchers at Washington University and Cal Tech found that, \"registered voters with low levels of educational attainment or lower levels of income are less likely to vote the more restrictive the voter identification regime.\" Barring former felons from voting has an even more dramatic impact on the poor, since almost half of state prison inmates earned less than $10,000 in the year before their incarceration.\nObviously, the United States is not Hong Kong. But there\u2019s a reason some of the city\u2019s demonstrators have adopted the label \"Occupy.\" Like the Americans who assembled in Zuccotti Park in 2011, they are fighting a system in which political exclusion and economic exclusion reinforce each other. Hong Kong\u2019s chief oligarch is named C.Y. Leung. But here in the U.S., we have ours too.",

        "postText": "How you spend your weekend says a lot about you. Here\u2019s how successful people do it:",
        "targetParagraphs": "As co-founder of Hotwire.com and CEO of Zillow for the last seven years, 39-year-old Spencer Rascoff fits most people's definition of success. As a father of three young children, Spencer is a busy guy at home and at work.\nWhat's the one thing that Spencer refuses to do on the weekend? Work at least, in the traditional sense.\nJacquelyn Smith shared some interesting insights from Spencer in her article on how successful people spend their weekends:\nI never go into the office on weekends, Spencer says, but I do check e-mail at night. My weekends are an important time to unplug from the day-to-day and get a chance to think more deeply about my company and my industry. Weekends are a great chance to reflect and be more introspective about bigger issues.\nA new study from Stanford shows that Rascoff is on to something.\nThe study found that productivity per hour declines sharply when the workweek exceeds 50 hours, and it drops off so much after 55 hours that there's no point in working any more. That's right, people who work as much as 70 hours (or more) per week actually get the same amount done as people who work 55 hours. Those extra hours are wasted.\nSuccessful people know the importance of shifting gears on the weekend to relaxing and rejuvenating activities. Like Spencer, they use their weekends to create a better week ahead.\nThis is easier said than done, so here's some help. The following list contains 10 things that successful people do to find balance on the weekend and to come into work at 110% on Monday morning.\n1. They Wake Up at the Same Time\nIt's tempting to sleep in on the weekend to catch up on your sleep. Though it feels good temporarily, having an inconsistent wake-up time disturbs your circadian rhythm. Your body cycles through an elaborate series of sleep phases in order for you to wake up rested and refreshed. One of these phases involves preparing your mind to be awake and alert, which is why people often wake up just before their alarm clock goes off (the brain is trained and ready). When you sleep past your regular wake-up time on the weekend, you end up feeling groggy and tired. This isn't just disruptive to your day off, it also makes you less productive on Monday because your brain isn't ready to wake up at your regular time. If you need to catch up on sleep, just go to bed earlier.\n2. They Designate Mornings as Me Time\nIt can be difficult to get time to yourself on the weekends, especially if you have family. Finding a way to engage in an activity you're passionate about first thing in the morning can pay massive dividends in happiness and cleanliness of mind. It's also a great way to perfect your circadian rhythm by forcing yourself to wake up at the same time you do on weekdays. Your mind achieves peak performance two-to-four hours after you wake up, so get up early to do something physical, and then sit down and engage in something mental while your mind is at its peak.\n3. They Schedule Micro-Adventures\nBuy tickets to a concert or play, or get reservations for that cool new hotel that just opened downtown. Instead of running on a treadmill, plan a hike. Try something you haven't done before or perhaps something you haven't done in a long time. Studies show that anticipating something good to come is a significant part of what makes the activity pleasurable. Knowing that you have something interesting planned for Saturday will not only be fun come Saturday, but it will significantly improve your mood throughout the week.\n4. They Pursue a Passion\nYou might be surprised what happens when you pursue something you're passionate about on weekends. Indulging your passions is a great way to escape stress and to open your mind to new ways of thinking. Things like playing music, reading, writing, painting, or even playing catch with your kids can help stimulate different modes of thought that can reap huge dividends over the coming week.\n5. They Disconnect\nDisconnecting is the most important weekend strategy on this list, because if you can't find a way to remove yourself electronically from your work Friday evening through Monday morning, then you've never really left work.\nMaking yourself available to your work 24/7 exposes you to a constant barrage of stressors that prevent you from refocusing and recharging. If taking the entire weekend off handling work e-mails and calls isn't realistic, try designating specific times on Saturday and Sunday for checking e-mails and responding to voicemails. For example, check your messages on Saturday afternoon while your kids are getting a haircut and on Sunday evenings after dinner. Scheduling short blocks of time will alleviate stress without sacrificing availability.\n6. They Minimize Chores\nChores have a funny habit of completely taking over your weekends. When this happens, you lose the opportunity to relax and reflect. What's worse is that a lot of chores feel like work, and if you spend all weekend doing them, you just put in a seven-day workweek. To keep this from happening, you need to schedule your chores like you would anything else during the week, and if you don't complete them during the allotted time, you move on and finish them the following weekend.\n7. They Exercise\nNo time to exercise during the week? You have 48 hours every weekend to make it happen. Getting your body moving for as little as 10 minutes releases GABA, a soothing neurotransmitter that reduces stress. Exercise is also a great way to come up with new ideas. Innovators and other successful people know that being outdoors often sparks creativity.\nI know that a lot of my best ideas come to me while I'm surfing. While you're out in the ocean, the combination of invigorating activity and beautiful scenery creates the perfect environment for an influx of creativity. Whether you're running, cycling, or gardening, exercise leads to endorphin-fueled introspection. The key is to find a physical activity that does this for you and then to make it an important part of your weekend routine.\n8. They Reflect\nWeekly reflection is a powerful tool for improvement. Use the weekend to contemplate the larger forces that are shaping your industry, your organization, and your job. Without the distractions of Monday to Friday busy work, you should be able to see things in a whole new light. Use this insight to alter your approach to the coming week, improving the efficiency and efficacy of your work.\n9. They Spend Quality Time with Family\nSpending quality time with your family on the weekend is essential if you want to recharge and relax. Family time on the weekend is so important to Spencer Rascoff that he flies home for the weekend, no matter how far away he is, even if he has to be in the same city the following week. Weekdays are so hectic that the entire week can fly by with little quality family time. Don't let this bleed into your weekends. Take your kids to the park, take your spouse to his or her favorite restaurant, and go visit your parents. You'll be glad you did.\n10. They Prepare for the Upcoming Week\nThe weekend is a great time to spend a few moments planning your upcoming week. As little as 30 minutes of planning can yield significant gains in productivity and reduced stress. The week feels a lot more manageable when you go into it with a plan because all you have to do is execute it.",

        "targetParagraphs": "Get ready to finally embrace your short stature, Skee-Lo!\nWe've long known that short people live longer than the taller among us. Past studies have examined the relationship between height and lifespan of populations around the world, suggesting that shorter people generally live longer lives, while taller people are more likely to have certain illnesses and develop various types of cancer.\nNow, thanks to new research published in the journal PLOS ONE, researchers have finally discovered the secret behind shorter people's longevity: It's in their genes.\nUsing data from a long-term observational study of Japanese-American men in Hawaii, researchers demonstrated that a gene linked to longevity, called FOXO3, is also linked to body size. What's more, researchers found that the shorter a person was, the more likely they were to have a long life.\nIn one of the world's largest and longest-running studies of aging men, researchers at the University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine, Kuakini Medical Center and U.S. Veterans Affairs ran an analysis by dividing more than 8,000 subjects into two height groups -- 5'2\" and shorter and 5'4\" and taller -- and looking at their heights, health and death rates over a 40 year period.\n\"The folks who were 5'2\" and shorter lived the longest,\" Dr. Bradley Wilcox, a researcher and professor at the UH Manoa's Department of Geriatric Medicine, told Hawaii News Now. \"They also had lower fasting insulin levels and got less cancer.\"\nAnd while 5'2\" is very short -- the average height of an American male is 5'9\" -- the results were heartening for \"taller\" short guys too: Data showed that lifespan and stature were linked so that the taller a man was, the shorter his lifespan was as well:\nThe research showed, for the first time, that the \"longevity gene\" FOXO3 is linked to human body size. \"We knew that in animal models of aging. We did not know that in humans,\" Dr. Willcox said in a statement. \"We have the same or a slightly different version [of the gene] in mice, roundworms, flies, even yeast ... it\u2019s important in longevity across all these species.\"\n\"The small yeast, flies and mice have genes like FOXO3 that dampen insulin signaling and make them smaller from birth,\" said Dr. Willcox of the image above.\nIn order to make that same connection with their human subjects, Dr. Willcox and his team compared the genotypes of men that lived to be 95 years and older with those in the study who lived an average lifespan.\n\"What we found was that those who lived a long time versus those who lived an average time tended to have a certain version of the FOXO3 gene,\" Dr. Willcox told HuffPost. They discovered that people with the \"protective\" version of the gene had double the odds of living to 100 -- triple, if the person inherited that gene from both parents.\n\"If you're bigger you have more cells, so you have to grow more and you use up a lot of those cells,\" researcher Dr. Tim Donlon theorized to Hawaii News Now. \"My feeling is that if you're shorter, you have a reserve of cells you can use later in life, and that might have some impact on why shorter people or smaller people have a longer life span.\"\nAs Hawaii News Now points out, the longevity gene acts \"like a stress resistance gene. It sees problems and fixes them. For example, if there are too many cancer cells around, it will eradicate them. Everyone has it, but only 4 percent of people have the protective version.\"\n\"One of the reasons why Honolulu is perfect for this kind of study is that we have the longest-lived state in the country, combined with a population that has remained, for the most part, in Hawaii,\" Dr. Willcox said in a statement. He also noted that \"no matter how tall you are you can still live a healthy lifestyle\" to make up for not having the protective FOXO3 gene.\nWhile the study could potentially apply to women and other ethnicities, researchers say that more research is needed to verify whether the results can be generalized beyond Japanese-American men. But Dr. Willcox seems confident that it will.\n\"People aren't all that different. Genetically, we're all pretty similar,\" he told HuffPost. \"If this effect applies to model organisms, than you can be pretty sure that it applies to other humans because humans are a lot more similar to each other than they are to model organisms.\"",
